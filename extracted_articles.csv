Astronauts on Gaganyaan mission trained at same centre in Russia where Rakesh Sharma underwent training,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 15:41 IST","NEW DELHI: The first four astronauts for India's groundbreaking human spaceflight initiative, Gaganyaan, underwent comprehensive training at Russia's Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center — a historical centre where Rakesh Sharma, India's pioneer in space, had previously trained in 1984.
PM Modi inaugurates 3 major ISRO projects: India to have its own space station by 2025

Located in Star City, just north of Moscow, the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center is renowned for its cutting-edge facilities, encompassing integrated simulators and diverse survival training scenarios, including those in mountains, woodlands, marshes, deserts, the Arctic, and at sea.

Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma flew aboard the Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. He is the only Indian citizen to travel in space.
The Soyuz T-11 spacecraft carrying cosmonauts, including Sharma, docked with the Salyut 7 Orbital Station. Sharma spent 7 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes aboard the Salyut 7 during which his team conducted scientific and technical studies which included forty-three experimental sessions. His work was mainly in the fields of bio-medicine and remote sensing.

'Sare Jahan Se Accha'
The crew held a joint television news conference with officials in Moscow and then PM Indira Gandhi.
When Indira Gandhi asked Sharma how India looked from outer space, he replied, ""Sare Jahan Se Accha"" (the best in the world)"".
With Sharma's voyage aboard Soyuz T-11, India became the 14th nation to send a man to outer space.
Four astronauts named for Gaganyaan mission
During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kerala on Tuesday, he revealed the names of the selected Indian Air Force pilots set to embark on the Gaganyaan mission: Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla.
The announcement took place at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, where PM Modi not only reviewed the ongoing progress of the Gaganyaan mission but also conferred 'astronaut wings' upon the designated crew.

Gaganyaan, scheduled for launch in 2024-25, holds the objective of showcasing India's human spaceflight capabilities by sending a crew into a 400 km orbit for a three-day mission and safely returning them to Earth—landing in Indian sea waters.
The mission necessitates the development of critical technologies, including a human-rated launch vehicle, life support systems, and provisions for crew safety during emergencies.
In his address at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, PM Modi highlighted the significant strides made by India in space exploration and underscored the transformative role of the Gaganyaan project in elevating the nation's standing in the global space sector.
The mission's success will not only mark a historic achievement for India but also contribute to inspiring a scientific temperament among the country's youth.

The year 2023 witnessed India's prowess in space exploration with the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon's South Pole and the launch of Aditya-L1, the country's maiden solar mission. These accomplishments not only solidified India's position in the global space economy but also acted as catalysts for the burgeoning private space sector within the country.
Looking ahead, India's ambitious plans include the establishment of the 'Bharatiya Antariksha Station' by 2035 and sending the first Indian astronaut to the Moon by 2040.
These visionary initiatives signify India's commitment to advancing its capabilities in space exploration and cementing its position as a formidable player in the realm of cosmic exploration.

BJP claims Himachal CM Sukhu has lost majority amid reports of cross-voting by Congress MLAs in Rajya Sabha election,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 16:08 IST","NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday claimed that Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu has lost majority amid reports that several Congress MLAs had cross-voted in the election for lone Rajya Sabha seat from the state. TV reports claim as many as 9 Congress MLAs may have cross-voted in favour of BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections.
The Congress has a comfortable majority of 40 in the 68-member House, while BJP has a strength of 25. The grand old party has fielded senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who is pitted against BJP's Harsh Mahajan. Mahajan is a three-time Congress MLA and former minister who resigned from the Congress in September 2022 and joined the BJP.
Leader of opposition in Himachal assembly Jairam Thakur claimed that the Congress government had lost majority in the state. ""Budget will be presented tomorrow. We will discuss budget tomorrow and then we will see the situation there. But I can see that the government has lost the majority,"" Jairam Thakur said.
CM Sukhu alleged that the BJP had tried to threaten the Congress leaders. ""We issued Whip, they didn't have the majority. Some MLAs did not come for voting despite the whip. We will decide what has to be done with those MLAs. In a way BJP has tried to threaten our leaders and Congress strongly condemns this,"" Sukhu said.

Tax-free meal benefits: Paytm's exit from employee benefits market may open door for competitors - here’s how,"Feb 27, 2024, 17:26 IST","Paytm crisis: Paytm's impending exit from the employee benefits market due to regulatory actions against its payments bank and mobile wallet has paved the way for other players like Pluxee (formerly Sodexo), Zaggle, and banks to grow their presence in this sector.
ET quoted a senior fintech executive saying that large corporations are seeking alternative options for meal benefits due to the upcoming halt in services for Paytm Payments Bank and its wallet after March 15.

Zaggle, a listed startup, aims to onboard 100-150 new corporate clients by the end of the next financial year. In recent months, the company has already begun partnerships with notable entities such as IT company Wipro, staffing solutions provider Quess Corp, private sector lender Axis Bank, and more.
Raj Narayanam, Executive Chairman of Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, noted, “In the meal benefit space, we have seen a massive uptick in demand and given the situation with competition, we have made steady inroads by adding new clients.”

He did not reveal the specific companies that transitioned from Paytm to Zaggle after January 31 when the Reserve Bank of India announced restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank.
Zaggle collaborates with banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, and IndusInd Bank to provide prepaid payment services to its corporate clients. In addition to meal vouchers and employee benefits, Zaggle also offers companies a spending management tool.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the company recorded a net profit of Rs 24.8 crore on operational revenue of Rs 502 crore. Presently, its market capitalization stands at around Rs 4,200 crore.

Industry insiders told the financial daily that Pluxee, the employee benefit business recently hived off from Sodexo, is also aiming to capitalise on new opportunities arising from the developments at Paytm Payments Bank.
A Pluxee spokesperson stated that its food wallet business has been experiencing substantial year-on-year growth, pre-dating the Paytm issue. However, they declined to comment on any specific increase in business following January 31.
Queries sent via email to Paytm received no response.
Changing landscape of employee benefits
Disruptions in the employee benefits space have highlighted the significance of tax-free meal benefits under India's tax regulations. Many companies provide a portion of employees' salaries as tax-free benefits, loading the funds into prepaid wallets linked to cards for transactions. These cards are restricted to use at merchant outlets selling food and beverages.
Various players, including French majors like Sodexo and Edenred, along with fintech startups like Zeta, have been key players in this domain. However, recent shifts, including Edenred India relinquishing its licence and Zeta selling its meal benefit business to Sodexo, have reshaped the competitive landscape.
HDFC Bank provides Foodplus meal cards, and ICICI Bank offers its meal cards. Sodexo recently spun off its meal benefits business as Pluxee. In recent years, Paytm has become a dominant fintech player in this sector.
The fintech executive mentioned earlier stated, “Paytm with its superior wallet offering and acceptance across the country had managed to grab a large market share in this business and was second competing with Sodexo, but now the leader board is set to get disrupted; Zaggle is trying to grab that space.”
Paytm provided the option for corporations to create sub-wallets for various expenses such as food, fuel, and similar items. Leveraging the popularity of the app and its extensive network of merchants, employees found it convenient to access and use funds easily.

Employee benefits industry: Margins, market size and compliance
The employee benefit industry presents an attractive opportunity for payment players, although profit margins in this segment are notably slim. To generate profits in this sector, companies often require ancillary services to supplement revenue. For Paytm, this niche business represented a small fraction of its broader fintech offerings, aiding its penetration into enterprises. Zaggle provides comprehensive spend management solutions, while Sodexo maintains diversified business interests spanning facilities management.
According to industry estimates, the current market size of this industry is approximately Rs 1 lakh crore in disbursements, benefiting roughly 15-18 million consumers. Some large companies make significant disbursements annually.
An executive was quoted anonymously saying that one of the largest financial services companies in the country disburses around Rs 1,500 crore every year to its employees, primarily for meal benefits.
The most critical aspect of this business is ensuring proper KYC of the final user, who is the employee, and guaranteeing that the funds are used at the appropriate places.
Raj Narayanam of Zaggle mentioned that tracking very small value payments based on merchant codes becomes challenging when using QR code-based payments. However, compliance is better managed through prepaid cards.
A senior HR executive at a large corporation stated that moving forward, most large companies will choose to engage with multiple vendors to mitigate the risk of disruption.
This person further added that banks are also advocating for sincere KYC of the final user of the wallet and clear understanding of its usage.",Times Of India

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ratcheted up calls to boost indigenous manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports, creating business prospects worth billions of dollars for country’s conglomerates such as the Adani Group, Tata Group, Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and Mahindra Group.
India’s heavy dependence on imports for defense requirements has not only constrained country’s strategic autonomy but also limited its economic potential, said Adani, who’s also the chief executive officer of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.

The manufacturing facility, that is expected to create over 4,000 jobs, aims to produce 2,00,000 rounds annually of large caliber artillery and tank ammunition by 2025, and five million rounds of medium caliber ammunition a year later. It’ll also be capable of making short-range and long-range missiles.

The 'dangerous' Google Maps error that made Google say sorry to two tourists,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:30 IST","A seemingly routine road trip turned into a harrowing ordeal for two German tourists who found themselves stranded in the heart of Australia’s wilderness. The culprits? None other than Google Maps, which led them astray with a faulty route.
Philipp Maier and Marcel Schione were en route to the small town of Bamaga in Queensland’s northern region. Armed with the world’s most-used navigation app, they embarked on what should have been a straightforward drive.
However, Google Maps had other plans.
The app directed them onto a remote dirt road, which turned out to be the entrance to the Oyala Thumotang National Park. Unfortunately, the park had been closed to the public since December 2023 — something they had no idea about. As their vehicle sank into wet mud, they realized they were trapped—no cell service, no way out.
Stranded and desperate, the two tourists camped inside their bogged-down car for nearly a week. The duo tried to build a tent but that didn’t last for too long. With no rescue in sight, they decided to attempt to escape on foot, noted a report by Business Insider. Their journey was nothing short of a nightmare and they said that they certainly saw a crocodile in a creek.

A Google spokesperson acknowledged the mishap, stating that the road in question had been removed from Google Maps. A spokesperson for Google told Business Insider: ""We apologise for this incident and are relieved that Philipp and Marcel are safe. We can confirm that this path has been removed from the map.""
As Maier aptly put it, ""We decided, 'OK, let's follow Google Maps because Google Maps knows maybe more than we know’,”. Clearly, Google Maps didn’t know more or what it knew proved rather tricky for the two tourists. Google utilises a variety of sources to keep its maps up-to-date, which encompass third-party information, user submissions, Street View, and satellite imagery. The company confirmed that it has removed the particular trail that led the two tourists astray.

At present, the brand, as part of its ‘India 2.0’ strategy, has been doing well in India. However, it offers only petrol engine options across its entire lineup. On the other hand, the demand for diesel cars, particularly in the SUV segment, has remained robust despite the increasingly stringent emission norms. On that note, the carmaker would like to expand its portfolio with diesel engine options, limited to the flagship sedan as of late 2024.
The 2024 Superb made its global debut in November last year. In the international markets, the new Superb gets six engine options: three petrol, two diesel, and a PHEV. However, when the model arrives in India, it will likely feature two engine options: a locally manufactured 2.0-litre turbo petrol unit and a fully-imported diesel trim.

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

First Hindu stone temple in Abu Dhabi set to open for public on March 1,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 15:50 IST","NEW DELHI: Abu Dhabi's first Hindu stone temple, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month, will open its doors to the public on March 1, as confirmed by the temple authorities.
The public can visit the temple, built at an approximate cost of Rs 700 crore, from 9am-8pm six days a week barring Mondays.
Constructed by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) Swaminarayan Sanstha, the temple spans over a vast 27-acre site in Abu Mureikhah near Al Rahba, just off the Dubai-Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Highway.

During a dedication ceremony attended by over 5,000 invitees, PM Modi inaugurated the grand temple on February 14. From February 15 to 29, overseas devotees who had registered in advance, along with VIP guests, were granted access to visit the temple.

The temple, constructed using 18 lakh bricks and 1.8 lakh cubic meters of sandstone sourced from Rajasthan, follows the Nagara style of architecture, similar to the recently inaugurated Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
The BAPS Hindu Mandir is currently the largest in the entire Gulf region, with Dubai already housing three other Hindu temples.
The stone temple's architecture incorporates seven spires, symbolizing the seven Emirates of the UAE, along with carvings of camels and the national bird, the falcon, to represent the host country. Swami Brahmaviharidas, head of international relations for BAPS, had told PTI that, ""the seven spires have idols of deities, including Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Lord Jagannath, Lord Krishna, Lord Swaminarayan (considered a reincarnation of Lord Krishna), Tirupati Balaji and Lord Ayappa. The seven shikhars represent the seven Emirates of the UAE.""

To ensure equal representation to the host country, the temple design includes UAE's national bird, the falcon, along with animals like elephants, camels, and lions, which hold significant places in Indian mythology. The temple showcases 15 tales from India, including the Ramayana and Mahabharata and stories from various other civilizations such as Mayan, Aztec, Egyptian, Arabic, European, Chinese, and African.
The temple's outer walls are constructed using sandstone imported from India, while the architectural elements include two ghumats (domes)-the ""Dome of Peace"" and the ""Dome of Harmony"", twelve samrans (dome-like structures), and 402 pillars. On either side of the temple, holy water flows from Ganga and Yamuna, brought all the way from India in large containers.
There is a visitor's centre, prayer halls, library, classroom, playground, garden and shops also available for the people.

Rajya Sabha Polls: SP chief whip resigns hours after skipping Akhilesh's dinner meet,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 13:51 IST","NEW DELHI: High-octane polls for Rajya Sabha are under way in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh as apprehension of cross-voting looms large among political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, and Samajwadi Party (SP).
Polls on Tuesday are being held for 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, four in Karnataka and one seat in Himachal Pradesh.
The counting will begin from 5 pm onwards. Out of a total of 56 candidates, 41 have already been declared victorious as they were elected unopposed for the Upper House.
The Rajya Sabha currently comprises 245 members. Members of the Upper House serve a six-year term, with elections held every two years for one-third of the seats, amounting to 33 per cent.

Samajwadi Party MLA and leader Manoj Kumar Pandey resigned from the post of Samajwadi Party chief whip before he cast his vote Tuesday morning. Pandy stepped down from the chief whip post amid cross-voting probabilites.
After five Samajwadi Party MLAs met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath after casting their vote for the Rajya Sabha election, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that disciplinary action would be taken against the MLAs if they had cross-voted.

Crucial battle in UP ahead of Lok Sabha polls:
Election results of the ten Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh could mark the first poll square-off between the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the SP-Congress combine ahead of the impending Lok Sabha elections. The Rajya Sabha battle in Uttar Pradesh grabbed attention after BJP fielded former MP Sanjay Seth as the eighth candidate.
BJP earlier fielded seven candidates: former Congress MP from Kushinagar and Union minister
RPN Singh, former Agra mayor Navin Jain, two former UP MLAs, Sangeeta Balwant and Sadhna Singh, BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former Mathura MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh and UP BJP state general secretary Amar Pal Maurya.
Ahead of the polls in Uttar Pradesh, the speculation of cross-voting gained ground after eight SP MLAs did not turn up for the meeting of legislators that the party chief Akhilesh Yadav called on the election eve, sources said.
Karnataka number game:
The Congress on Monday shifted all its MLAs to a hotel ahead of the biennial election to fill four vacancies from Karnataka in Rajya Sabha apparently to keep the flock together.
Five candidates -- Ajay Maken, Syed Naseer Hussain and G C Chandrasekhar (all Congress), Narayansa Bandage (BJP) and Kupendra Reddy (JD(S)) -- are in the fray. All parties had issued whips to the MLAs amid apprehensions of cross-voting.
The Congress has 134 MLAs, the BJP has 66, JD (S) 19, while others account for four.
Of the four others, the Congress claims the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and is confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the chief minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.
The Rajya Sabha election scene in Karnataka heated up after the BJP-JD(S) combine fielded its second candidate (Kupendra Reddy), even though the alliance had the strength to win only one out of the four seats.
According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, then preference votes kick in.
BJP fields candidate to test Congress's faultline over 'outsider' Singhvi
As most states where Congress has a stake witness unopposed elections to Rajya Sabha, all eyes are on Himachal where opposition BJP has fielded a candidate to necessitate voting even as the saffron party has complained to the poll panel about a whip issued by Congress.
While the gap between Congress and BJP is big, with 43 MLAs backing the former, BJP's decision to file a nomination stems from the reported unease among some Congress legislators in the state on the party's decision to field an 'outsider' in Abhishek Singhvi. Also, veteran Anand Sharma is said to be miffed at being overlooked in his home state.
Congress managers have debunked the possibility of trouble by citing that all 43 MLAs have signed the nomination papers of Singhvi.

Smriti Kalra remembers Satish Kaushik's 'childlike heart and enthusiasm': It was his dream to release 'Kaagaz 2' in theatres - Exclusive,"Feb 27, 2024, 18:12 IST","Smriti Kalra is all geared up for the release of her upcoming film, 'Kaagaz 2'. Ahead of the release of the film on March 1, the actress engaged in a freewheeling interview with ETimes where she spoke about working with the late Satish Kaushik, sharing screen space with actors like Anupam Kher, Neena Gupta, and Darshan Kumaar and more. Excerpts...
The trailer of 'Kaagaz 2' has been receiving positive reviews from all sides. How does it feel?
You know, sometimes words are never enough to fully express how one feels. Elated, happy, on top of the world— they don't exactly capture the depth of emotions. I will just say that everyone advises to focus on karma, not the results. But for an artist, especially, audience feedback is crucial. It validates our efforts and keeps us motivated. So, receiving positive feedback makes me ecstatic. Yes, ecstatic is the word.
How did you come on board for the project?

I was informed that the audition script was shared with me during the COVID times, and I submitted a self-test. Upon reading the script, I immediately loved it and expressed my eagerness to participate. However, things didn't align initially, which left me disheartened. Then, I received a call informing me that Mr. Satish Kaushik wanted to meet me at the office. During the meeting, he mentioned having read my writing on Instagram, which made me very happy. He asked me to read it aloud while he recorded. I shared a series I had written about a boy and a girl meeting but not speaking. He seemed impressed and declared, ""I've found my Tanisha."" I learned they had been searching for Tanisha for one and a half years, and I was chosen for the role.


After the success of 'Kaagaz', the second installment of the film was much anticipated. The film has become even more special now because it marks Satish Kaushik's last film.
During the COVID pandemic, 'Kagaz' premiered on OTT platforms and garnered significant appreciation due to its compelling subject matter. 'Kaagaz 2' was Satish sir's dream to release in theatres, which has now come true. It's both brilliant and unfortunate that he's not physically present to witness it, but his spirit lives on. 'Kaagaz 2' hit theaters on March 1st, a story deeply cherished by Satish sir. He was deeply involved in the film's creation, passionately discussing every scene.
Kaagaz 2 Interview | Anupam Kher remembers Satish Kaushik, Darshan Kumaar, Smriti Kalra

How was your experience working with Satish Kaushik?
Working with him as I mentioned earlier, is akin to a potter shaping clay. He assisted me in shaping my character, Tanisha. Just being around experienced individuals allows for subconscious learning. Yes, I have learned a lot from him. The experience of working with Satish Kaushik Sir is unlike that of a father figure who reprimands and pushes you forward. It's more supportive and nurturing.

What is the most valuable lesson you have learned from the late actor-director?
The valuable lesson I learned from Satish sir is when he said, ""Give your 100 percent, Smriti. How much more than 100 percent can you give?"" That defines and differentiates you. I always remember his words. Another aspect, I won't call it a lesson but a reminder, is his childlike heart and enthusiasm, even at his age. It felt like he was shooting for the first time with such enthusiasm and excitement during 'Kaagaz 2'. It's a reminder to always maintain the awe and wonder of a child, experiencing everything as if it's for the first time.
The film also features actors like Anupam Kher, Neena Gupta, and Darshan Kumaar. How was it sharing screen space with them?
I am not just saying this for the sake of it, but I genuinely feel honored to be working with esteemed actors like Anupam Kher sir, Neena Gupta ma'am, Darshan, Satish sir, and the entire cast. They are incredibly experienced individuals whom I've admired while growing up, and now, I find myself sharing the same frame and set with them. It's truly an honor, and the word that constantly echoes in my mind and heart is 'honored.' I am ecstatic, thrilled, and deeply honored to be sharing this space with such thorough and humble individuals.",Times Of India

"Govinda arrived 6-7 hours late, while Big B was present at 9:am on the sets of Bade Miyan Chote Miya, Shehzad Khan recalls","Feb 27, 2024, 18:32 IST","'Bade Miyan Chote Miyan' star Shehzad Khan, in an interview, recalled how Govinda consistently arrived 6-7 hours behind schedule, in stark contrast to the punctuality of Amitabh Bachchan, who would reliably appear at the set by 9 a.m..
Reflecting on his positive working experience with filmmaker David Dhawan, Khan recounted to Siddharth Kannan that Dhawan adeptly managed Govinda's tardiness without Amitabh Bachchan noticing by engaging the latter in productive tasks.

Khan praised David Dhawan's directorial prowess, remarking on the stark contrast in arrival times between Amitabh Bachchan, who would arrive promptly at 9 a.m., and Govinda, who typically appeared between 3 and 4 p.m. Khan humorously likened the situation to the variance between IST (Indian Standard Time) and GST (Govinda Standard Time), acknowledging their roles as character actors and Dhawan's approach to managing the situation.
Several individuals, including Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon, advertising expert Prahlad Kakkar, and character actor Guddi Maruti, who have collaborated with Govinda, have recounted instances of the actor's tardiness on film sets.

Won't allow child marriage as long as I'm alive: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11 IST","GUWAHATI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in the assembly on Monday that he will not allow any child marriage in the state as long as he is alive.
""I want to make it loud and clear that till the time I am there, I will not allow you (Opposition) to play with the future of innocent Muslim children. I will bring an end to this exploitative business and will not allow a single child marriage to take place in Assam.""
He added, ""We will completely close the shop that you people have opened to ruin the daughters of the Muslim community by 2026.""
The CM made these statements after the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Congress wanted to bring an adjournment motion in the House over the recent state cabinet decision to repeal the ""Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act"".

A IUDF MLA Karim Uddin Barbhuiya pleaded with speaker Biswajit Daimary to allow the adjournment motion on the decision to repeal the “Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act”. However, the speaker rejected it saying the matter is yet to be brought in the House.
This was also supported by Congress members of the House. Leader of the Opposition in the assembly and senior Congress leader, Debabrata Saikia, said the House should have been informed before taking any cabinet decision at a time when a session is undergoing. Responding to this, CM Sarma said, “We have not done anything outside the rule.
The rule is that a bill is first approved in the cabinet and then introduced in the House. We want to repeal the Act because it has provision of child marriage. A cabinet decision has been taken. The bill is yet to be introduced in the House.” Following this, the Congress MLAs walked out of the assembly, while the AIUDF MLAs staged a sit-in before the speaker.

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Tax-free meal benefits: Paytm's exit from employee benefits market may open door for competitors - here’s how,"Feb 27, 2024, 17:26 IST","Paytm crisis: Paytm's impending exit from the employee benefits market due to regulatory actions against its payments bank and mobile wallet has paved the way for other players like Pluxee (formerly Sodexo), Zaggle, and banks to grow their presence in this sector.
ET quoted a senior fintech executive saying that large corporations are seeking alternative options for meal benefits due to the upcoming halt in services for Paytm Payments Bank and its wallet after March 15.

Zaggle, a listed startup, aims to onboard 100-150 new corporate clients by the end of the next financial year. In recent months, the company has already begun partnerships with notable entities such as IT company Wipro, staffing solutions provider Quess Corp, private sector lender Axis Bank, and more.
Raj Narayanam, Executive Chairman of Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, noted, “In the meal benefit space, we have seen a massive uptick in demand and given the situation with competition, we have made steady inroads by adding new clients.”

He did not reveal the specific companies that transitioned from Paytm to Zaggle after January 31 when the Reserve Bank of India announced restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank.
Zaggle collaborates with banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, and IndusInd Bank to provide prepaid payment services to its corporate clients. In addition to meal vouchers and employee benefits, Zaggle also offers companies a spending management tool.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the company recorded a net profit of Rs 24.8 crore on operational revenue of Rs 502 crore. Presently, its market capitalization stands at around Rs 4,200 crore.

Industry insiders told the financial daily that Pluxee, the employee benefit business recently hived off from Sodexo, is also aiming to capitalise on new opportunities arising from the developments at Paytm Payments Bank.
A Pluxee spokesperson stated that its food wallet business has been experiencing substantial year-on-year growth, pre-dating the Paytm issue. However, they declined to comment on any specific increase in business following January 31.
Queries sent via email to Paytm received no response.
Changing landscape of employee benefits
Disruptions in the employee benefits space have highlighted the significance of tax-free meal benefits under India's tax regulations. Many companies provide a portion of employees' salaries as tax-free benefits, loading the funds into prepaid wallets linked to cards for transactions. These cards are restricted to use at merchant outlets selling food and beverages.
Various players, including French majors like Sodexo and Edenred, along with fintech startups like Zeta, have been key players in this domain. However, recent shifts, including Edenred India relinquishing its licence and Zeta selling its meal benefit business to Sodexo, have reshaped the competitive landscape.
HDFC Bank provides Foodplus meal cards, and ICICI Bank offers its meal cards. Sodexo recently spun off its meal benefits business as Pluxee. In recent years, Paytm has become a dominant fintech player in this sector.
The fintech executive mentioned earlier stated, “Paytm with its superior wallet offering and acceptance across the country had managed to grab a large market share in this business and was second competing with Sodexo, but now the leader board is set to get disrupted; Zaggle is trying to grab that space.”
Paytm provided the option for corporations to create sub-wallets for various expenses such as food, fuel, and similar items. Leveraging the popularity of the app and its extensive network of merchants, employees found it convenient to access and use funds easily.

Employee benefits industry: Margins, market size and compliance
The employee benefit industry presents an attractive opportunity for payment players, although profit margins in this segment are notably slim. To generate profits in this sector, companies often require ancillary services to supplement revenue. For Paytm, this niche business represented a small fraction of its broader fintech offerings, aiding its penetration into enterprises. Zaggle provides comprehensive spend management solutions, while Sodexo maintains diversified business interests spanning facilities management.
According to industry estimates, the current market size of this industry is approximately Rs 1 lakh crore in disbursements, benefiting roughly 15-18 million consumers. Some large companies make significant disbursements annually.
An executive was quoted anonymously saying that one of the largest financial services companies in the country disburses around Rs 1,500 crore every year to its employees, primarily for meal benefits.
The most critical aspect of this business is ensuring proper KYC of the final user, who is the employee, and guaranteeing that the funds are used at the appropriate places.
Raj Narayanam of Zaggle mentioned that tracking very small value payments based on merchant codes becomes challenging when using QR code-based payments. However, compliance is better managed through prepaid cards.
A senior HR executive at a large corporation stated that moving forward, most large companies will choose to engage with multiple vendors to mitigate the risk of disruption.
This person further added that banks are also advocating for sincere KYC of the final user of the wallet and clear understanding of its usage.",Times Of India
Russian court jails veteran activist Orlov for 2.5 years,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 17:52 IST","MOSCOW: A Russian court on Tuesday sentenced top human rights campaigner Oleg Orlov to two and a half years in jail for denouncing Russia's assault on Ukraine.
The 70-year-old, a key figure of the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial group, is the latest target of Kremlin repression, which has intensified since the offensive in Ukraine.
""The court has determined Orlov's guilt and orders a sentence of two years and six months... in a general regime penal colony,"" the judge said.
As the judge read the verdict, the bespectacled, white-haired activist winked at his wife, fellow activist Tatyana.

He was taken into custody in the courtroom and asked Tatyana to come over.
""Tanya, you promised me!"" he told her as she appeared to tear up.
Around 200 supporters were waiting in the corridor outside the courtroom to bid him goodbye.
Orlov had told AFP in a recent interview that he held no illusions on the outcome of the trial.
Orlov was accused of discrediting the Russian army in a column written for the French online publication Mediapart, and fined in October after a first trial.

The fine was a relatively lenient punishment and prosecutors called for a new trial.
Even as other campaigners fled the growing repression, Orlov remained in Russia, where he said he was ""more useful"" than abroad.
He told AFP that his career spent working on the historical memory of Soviet crimes and rights abuses in modern Russia -- especially in the North Caucasus -- gave him no choice but to also campaign against the Ukraine offensive.
Memorial established itself as a key pillar of Russian civil society by preserving the memory of victims of communist repression and by campaigning against rights violations.
The organisation was officially disbanded by Russian authorities in late 2021 and it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 alongside a leading Ukrainian rights group and a veteran Belarusian activist.

DC Edit | Positive turn for Rahul’s yatra,26 Feb 2024 11:25 PM,"The Yatra had run into trouble in its early phase itself with Trinamul Congress, a key ally of the Congress in the I.N.D.I.A. bloc, refusing to facilitate it in West Bengal where it runs the state government, leave alone Ms Mamata Banerjee, its leader, joining it. The unilateral announcement by the Trinamul that it was able to spare only two seats for the Congress had practically ended the scope of the alliance in the state, given that the Congress had won as many seats in the state going solo last time around.
Mr Yadav’s conciliatory approach comes at a time when I.N.D.I.A. bloc was facing an existential threat. The Congress’ preoccupation with the state assembly elections held in October and November and its ignoring the very cause for which the Opposition bloc was formed had created a lot of bad blood within the formation. Nitish Kumar, one of the principal actors behind the alliance, even quit it, leaving a question mark on its very survival.
The sense of purpose demonstrated by the Yadav leaders — RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and SP’s president — and the quick brokering of an electoral deal between the Aam Admi Party and the Congress in four states have together put the alliance back on track. That the alliance will hold its first public rally, which it was unable to organise despite several attempts in the past, on March 3 in Patna in which senior leaders are expected to be present, must give it the much needed booster dose ahead of the elections.

"Aakar Patel | Desis in America show solidarity for secular India, Palestinian rights",26 Feb 2024 11:16 PM,"Hosted by the Boston South Asian Coalition, it featured two speakers. One was our Teesta Setalvad, heroine of the struggle for justice in Gujarat. The other was a young man from South Lebanon named Saleem Hallal. In the audience were a few dozen people, including several desis, and to my mind this was what made this gathering especially interesting and I will write about why that is later.
The talks by the two speakers were focused on the facts. About communal crimes in one place condoned by the State (some would say encouraged by it) and in the other a national struggle for liberation.
There was also a common thread and that was historical revisionism and the rewriting of things. The idea in both Palestine and “New India” that something else used to be here on the ground and in this land a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago. And that idea and that notion therefore justifies violence against people and against structures and monuments in the present.
A lot of people in the audience, including myself, found themselves nodding at the parallels. Ms Setalvad, who has been a friend for a few decades, was precise and deliberate in what she communicated to the gathering, most of whom may not have known of what had transpired in and after 2002 in Gujarat.
She spoke of the 174 individuals who had been convicted because of the courage and persistence of the survivors and activists. Of these, 124 were given life sentences. These were convictions that came often in the face of resistance from the State to the idea of justice. To understand what sort of effort that took, consider only how rapist-murderer convicts are today mollycoddled by the Government in India, which wants to release them for no reason other than bigotry.
Many people might not know now and many others who knew will have forgotten that the Supreme Court had moved the trials out of Gujarat, something that to the best of my knowledge has not happened since or before.
Mr Hallal spoke directly and with passion about how unjust was both the reality on the ground and the falsity of the narrative constructed to sustain it.
That early settlers into Israel survived because of the aid of Palestinians, he said, just as the early settlers in America had. What was happening in Palestine was not a religious conflict but one of the occupied against the occupier. He exposed how hollow it was to describe settler colonialism as the coming together of a “land without people for a people without a land”.
He explained how the narrative that the entire Israel-Palestine issue was “complicated” was merely something that was being used to make a far simpler reality more complicated. That of occupation and colonialism and the rewriting of history with a particular agenda. The talk is on the Boston South Asian Coalition YouTube page, and I would encourage all of you to see it.
Why I said I found this gathering interesting was that it is not uncommon for Indian groups in the United States to be shown as backing the government in India. Particularly on such issues as what the government does to minority Indians and in events that are organised by the State (“Howdy”). This is especially and unfortunately true of my own Gujarati community, who are often shown as being at the forefront of this defence of state communalism. But there is another side to this and there are other Indians, many of them, who are opposed to the path we have taken in recent years. It is those who I had joined on that day.
At the gathering I spoke briefly on what it was that Indians abroad could do. This was that they should use the democratic process in their country to engage with what was happening in India. The main reason that a discriminatory citizenship law was passed in India in 2019 but not implemented yet was the protest against it. But another reason was the condemnatory position taken against it by the European Parliament. One wonders why it was that MPs in far-off lands would be interested in what we might think of as being as our “internal affairs”, but it is clear that this was likely because Indians abroad were concerned enough to raise the law with their local legislator. India is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is no reason why our friends cannot remind us of this fact. And this, in turn, is more likely to happen if desis abroad engage more robustly with what is going on in India.
Solidarity is important not only because as human beings we should understand the suffering of others but because such participation is our duty.
The Preamble of the Constitution of India says that we Indians have resolved to secure for Indians “fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual”. Fraternity can come only when we stand up for each other. The desis of the Boston South Asian Coalition actually attempt to do that.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs 20,000 crore via equity; promoters to participate","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:08:00 PM IST","MUMBAI - Vodafone Idea Ltd has received board approval to raise Rs 20,000 crore through a combination of equity and equity-linked instruments.

“The Board has also authorised the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise,” the company said in an exchange filing.

The telecom operator will conduct an extraordinary general meeting with shareholders on April 2 and seek approval for the proposed fundraising.

If shareholders approve, the company expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter.

The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier, said.

Vodafone Idea remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying up debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise.

Through the combination of equity and debt, the cash-strapped operator plans to raise around Rs 45,000 crore.

Vodafone Idea’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs 4,500 crore.

“The equity and debt fund raising will enable the company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience,” the operator said.

As of December end, Vodafone Idea’s gross debt stood at Rs 2.15 lakh crore, comprising deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1.38 lakh crore, AGR liability of Rs 69,020 crore due to the government, optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1,660 crore, besides dues towards banks and financial institutions.

Vodafone Idea has managed to grow its 4G subscriber base and average revenue per user (ARPU) consecutively for the last 10 quarters. The improving operating metrics has prompted the company to tap the market for raising funds.

Vodafone Idea’s 4G subscriber base increased to 125.6 million from 121.6 million a year ago.

The company managed to trim its consolidated net loss to Rs 6,986 crore in the quarter ended December, from Rs 7,990 crore a year ago, and Rs 8,738 crore a quarter ago.

“The company has consistently shown an improvement in performance even with limited investments. With the proposed fundraise and the positive operational developments, the company is confident of effectively competing in the market,” Vodafone Idea said.

Ahead of the board meet outcome, shares of the company ended 4.5% down at Rs 16.10 on the National Stock Exchange.",The economic times
Mizuho courting India elite shows Japan banks’ global ambition,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:24:00 PM IST","Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s showcase of its business ties at Mumbai’s luxury St Regis hotel this month underscored its growing foothold in India, a market that has lately been endorsed by Wall Street giants.

An awards ceremony to fete financial professionals drew more than 150 executives from companies, including those backed by the country’s richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, according to people familiar with the matter. The Japanese bank hosted the event that’s now in its second year to build closer ties with the business community. It came as Mizuho announced its biggest-ever acquisition in India.

Mizuho’s celebration with its biggest clients also underscores inroads made by Japan megabanks in the world’s most populous country as global banks look for alternatives to China. They’ve vaulted to become the country’s largest arrangers of offshore loans, tapping into the appetite of tycoons to grow their empire. When the Adani Group sought to tout its deep bank ties last year in its rebuttal against short seller Hindenburg Research’s allegations, the Japanese lenders surfaced on the list as major backers in Asia.

“Japanese banks are increasingly gaining clout in India due to their competitive rates for credit facilities, a factor that American lenders envy,” said Srinath Sridharan, an independent policy researcher and corporate advisor. He warned however that if banks try to chase down loan pricing in a competitive market, this may trigger margin pressures and an under-estimation of underwriting risks.

Also Read: Japan's Mizuho aims to remain a top 10 global investment bank

Mizuho’s bigger Japanese peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rank among the top arrangers of Indian offshore loans in the last few years. They were toppled by HSBC Holdings Plc. last year. Notably, the Wall Street banks so far have rarely featured highly in these league tables.

Major US banks may be more constrained by concerns over backlash from their shareholders on their lending relationships, especially those that are in the spotlight for negative news, people familiar with the matter said.

Mizuho’s loan portfolio has shifted from lending largely to government entities to backing large Indian companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing strategic information.

The bank hired Piyush Agarwal from HSBC in 2019 where he was previously head of large local corporates in India. It has also tapped several senior client coverage bankers from other rivals to help expand its customer base, the people said, helping it forge lending ties with Reliance, JSW Group and Tata Group companies.

“India’s potential is not limited to its population,” a Mizuho spokesman said in response to queries from Bloomberg News. “Multiple factors are behind its potential: English being its official second language, plenty of math and IT talents, geographic advantage being in the middle of Indian Ocean, connecting Asia and Western Europe.” He said the bank plans to further grow in the country, without elaborating.

Bloomberg

At Japan’s biggest bank MUFG, Shashank Joshi, deputy chief executive officer in India, is seen as the key driver for its business in the country, helping to form bridges with the most important companies and local lenders. During the throes of Adani’s Hindenburg crisis for example, MUFG was among lenders that facilitated roadshows across the world as the conglomerate sought to win back investor trust.

MUFG CEO Hironori Kamezawa told Bloomberg News in an interview last year that India’s appeal is rising in comparison with China, and the bank continues to push growth there.

At Sumitomo Mitsui, its new CEO Toru Nakashima said Japan’s second-largest lender is mulling how to become more of a full-fledged financial player in India.

The banks didn’t elaborate further on their ambitions.

Chief business officer Rakesh Garg who joined Sumitomo Mitsui from Barclays Plc after more than 15 years at the British firm has been working to expand the client base and is also focusing on green financing, the people said. Sandeep Chopra, a veteran banker who was most recently at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., joined the bank in December to head its corporate coverage.

“Familiarity and success in the Indian market further incentivize Japanese banks to expand their operations in India,” said Sridharan.

Crorepati dream: 12 mutual funds deliver over 100x returns in 2-3 decades,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 06:10:00 PM IST","In a clear example of how compounding gives magical returns in the long run, at least 12 equity mutual funds have given mind-boggling returns of over 100 times when held since inception. A lumpsum investment of Rs 1 lakh (which wasn't a small amount in those days) would have turned you into a crorepati in 2-3 decades, an analysis by ETMutualFunds showed.

HDFC ELSS Tax saver, the topper in the list, offered 23.71% since its inception. A lumpsum investment of Rs 1 lakh in the scheme would have now been Rs 3.79 crore. The scheme has completed 27.93 years of existence in the market.

Nippon India Growth Fund offered 22.64% making a lumpsum investment of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3.28 crore in around 28 years.

The next two schemes were from Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund. Franklin India Prima Fund and Franklin India Bluechip Fund offered 19.51% and 19.35% respectively on lumpsum investments since their inception. The lumpsum investment would have now grown to Rs 2.19 crore and Rs 2.10 crore respectively.

The question is how does the power of compounding work well in the longer term? “Compounding is indeed a magical phenomenon in the world of investing, capable of turning even modest savings into substantial wealth over time. However, its true power reveals itself only to those who possess the patience and discipline to stay invested for the long term,” said Sagar Shinde, VP Research, Fisdom.

Example:
Agencies

Source: ACE MF, Fisdom Research.

The above data shows that the first five years laid a solid foundation, demonstrating the potential for capital appreciation. However, it's in the subsequent periods where the true potential of compounding becomes apparent. This acceleration in growth is a direct result of the compounding effect, where returns on investment generate further returns. Remarkably, in the subsequent five years, the investment skyrocketed to Rs 103.7 lakhs, showcasing a staggering fourfold increase from the initial amount.

He added that, “This exponential growth underscores the importance of patience and long-term commitment in realizing the full potential of compounding. By allowing investments to compound over extended periods, investors can unlock substantial wealth-creation opportunities and achieve their financial goals with greater ease.”

The next question is will the next 20 years match the massive return of the last 20 years that mutual fund investors have enjoyed?
“While the potential for massive returns like those seen in the last 20 years cannot be guaranteed, several factors suggest promising opportunities for mutual fund investors in the next two decades,” comments Shinde.

Firstly, India's robust macroeconomic fundamentals and it’s standing as one of the fastest-growing economies globally create a conducive environment for potential investment returns. This optimism is further supported by recent data indicating India's ascent to the fourth-largest stock market, surpassing Hong Kong. Additionally, Indian equities have outperformed most other emerging markets over the last decade, with MSCI India delivering a 10.8% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) compared to MSCI Emerging Markets' 3.2% CAGR as of January 31, 2024.

“Furthermore, the surge in Mutual Fund Asset Under Management (AUM) and Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) contributions by 20% and 24% (growth since FY17) respectively underscores growing investor interest in mutual funds. However, it's essential to note that despite this growth, mutual fund penetration in India remains relatively low, at less than 5% of the working-age population, and the MF AUM to GDP ratio is lower compared to many other countries,” he adds.

“While past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results, a combination of robust economic prospects, increased market penetration, and disciplined investing practices may contribute to favourable returns over the next two decades,” he further added.

We considered all equity categories such as large cap, mid cap, large & mid cap, small cap, multi cap, ELSS, flexi cap, focused fund, value fund,and contra fund for analysis. The CAGR returns were calculated since the inception of the scheme.

Note, the above exercise is not a recommendation. The exercise was done to find equity mutual fund schemes that turned a lumpsum investment of Rs 1 lakh into more than Rs 1 crore.

One should not make investment or redemption decisions based on the above exercise. One should always consider risk appetite, investment horizon, and goal before making any investment decisions.",The economic times

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times
Will higher EPS pension dream collapse due to EPFO's new calculation rules?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:00:00 AM IST","Applicants for higher pension under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS 95) may be in for a rude shock as there have been media reports that the EPFO is promoting a new rule to calculate the higher pension. The purported rule is based on giving higher pension on a pro-rata basis, which is likely to result in 30% to 40% lower pension for EPS-95 members.

“As per the communication from the EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation) offices in various places, it is true that the service period of an employee who has opted for higher pension is split into two parts,” says PV Murthy, Head of Labour & Employment Practice, Economic Laws Practice.

However, the EPFO has not issued any communication or a circular in this regard. “The EPFO has not given any official confirmation about the new methodology for calculating the new EPS pension. The pro-rata pension computation was not explained in a circular or released by the EPFO,” says Manmeet Kaur, Partner, Karanjawala & Co.

How will the pro-rata calculation of higher EPS pension work?
This new rule of calculating pension will primarily affect members who are still working or retired on or after September 1, 2014. The service period of these people will be considered in two parts for calculating average pensionable salary. “The first part from 16.11.1995 (the date of implementation of EPS-95) till 31.08.2014 and the second part commencing from 01.09.2014 till the date of retirement,” explains Murthy.

“For the first part, the average salary for the last 60 months is being reckoned for the calculation of pension and for the second part, the average salary for the last 60 months or the average salary from 01.09.2014 till the date of retirement, in case the date of retirement is before 31.08.2019, is being reckoned. The pension payable is, therefore, prorated by splitting it into two parts,” says Murthy.

How will this new calculation rule impact the members’ pension?
Till August 31, 2014, the EPS contribution was allowed only till the maximum wage ceiling, which was Rs 6,500. It was raised to Rs 15,000 from September 1, 2014. After this date, the maximum EPS contribution for new members was capped at the new wage ceiling of Rs 15,000 and a limited window for applying for higher contribution on actual salary was allowed to old members. This led to EPS members approaching various courts and the matter ultimately reached the Supreme Court which ruled in favour of all these old members and said that they were eligible to apply for higher EPS pension.

However the new calculation rule on pro-rata basis is likely to reduce the pension amount significantly. Since the wages before September 2014 were low, the average pensionable salary for the first period is likely to be very low for most people. If this pensionable salary is factored in on a pro-rata basis to calculate the final EPS pension, it will bring down the overall pension.

“The above approach adopted by the EPFO may result in a reduced pension of anywhere between 30 and 40% than what was contemplated by the judgement of the Supreme Court,” says Murthy.

Is it not against the spirit of the order passed by SC in this regard?
Any differentiation based on an arbitrary cut-off date appears not to be in sync with the line taken by the apex court while giving its verdict on higher EPS pension. “The Supreme Court had held that the cut-off period imposed under the amendment for exercise of the 2014 option was not valid,” says Kaur.

The SC judgement had restored the right of all eligible members to have an opportunity to apply for higher pension. “In my view, the above prorated approach adopted by the EPFO for calculation of higher pension is not in line with the spirit of the SC judgement,” says Murthy.

However, the current move by the EPFO appears to be aimed at reducing the pension amount in an indirect way by altering the pension calculation rule. “The EPFO might have been constrained to come out with this innovative approach since they may not have sufficient corpus to make the payments,” says Murthy.

What is the recourse left for members?
If the purported rule is applied to all members who have applied for higher pension, then it will be contrary to their expectation with which they applied for the higher pension. “Those who opted for higher pension are expressing concerns as the actual pension they receive will be much lower than what they anticipated,” adds Murthy.

The EPFO is yet to notify the new calculation rule. It is of utmost urgency that the EPFO clear the doubt among the members who have applied for higher pension. “In case the new methodology, as and when notified, puts retirees at a disadvantage, the retirees may challenge the same before appropriate legal forums, including the Supreme Court,” adds Kaur.",The economic times

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

Indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge inducted into Indian Army,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:56:00 PM IST","A 46-metre indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge was inducted into the Indian Army on Tuesday, a move that will bolster the crucial bridging capability of the force's engineers. The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

Consumer goods companies set to raise prices by 2-4% in 2024,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:08:00 AM IST","Kolkata | Mumbai: Consumer goods makers said there will be a ""modest increase"" of 2-4% in product prices in 2024 due to year-on-year inflation in some commodities and higher wage costs, which will help to improve price-led growth of the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry.

Companies such as Godrej Consumer Products, Dabur and Emami said price-led growth will be back for the industry. India's largest FMCG firm Hindustan Unilever (HUL) too expects some improvement. Dabur said it has increased prices by 2.5% across its food portfolio, while Emami said it is looking at around 3% price hikes this year.

Dabur India chief executive officer, Mohit Malhotra said the mix of inflation is moving towards food. For instance, if we look at food, cereals and spices, they are still in double-digit inflation, which is not very good. It went down, but it's picked up again, he said.

""Even in honey, there is inflation. We have just taken a price increase in oral care, for example, driven by our competitor taking up a price increase. In healthcare, we might be forced to take price increases. Even in spices. So wherever the shoe will pinch, we will have to hike prices,"" said Malhotra.



Price growth is a critical piece along with the most important volume sales for overall FMCG growth recovery, with the former turning into negative territory for most companies last year due to steep in input prices, which led to product price drops impacting sectoral growth. Around 65-70% of FMCG companies' growth has come from volume and the remaining from prices.

Godrej Consumer Products managing director, Sudhir Sitapati said commodity prices are now flat to slightly positive, while wage inflation is positive. Therefore, he said, product prices will be a little higher than before in the next few quarters, leading to a high single-digit value growth for the industry this year. ""The market growth rate will improve next fiscal,"" he said.

FMCG market researcher NielsenIQ said price growth in the sector fell to 2.7% in 2023 from 10% in the previous year owing to the decline in prices of most products. In 2022, there was record inflation in most FMCG input costs from palm oil to crude to packaging material due to the geopolitical situation.

HUL's chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari said the company wants to do a better job with its product mix with more product and beauty growth, promotion and its pullback, which he expects will lead to some price growth over the next 3-4 quarters.

""Long-term average for FMCG, we do expect 4% to 5% price growth to be there, which we have not seen, as you saw in the current quarter, in fact it was negative 2%, we do see marginal negative next quarter, and we will see how commodity plays out to see what this means in further quarters to come. But there has to be a healthy level of some amount of price growth as well to help overall headline growth,"" Tiwari told investors last month.

Most companies have reported higher volume growth than value growth in the past few quarters due to the fall in prices, even as overall remains tepid.

The edible oil segment, which saw unprecedented price in the past two years, has seen increased price stability in the past two-three quarters. chief executive officer Sanjeev Asthana told analysts earlier this month that in the past one week, prices were stable to marginally higher.",The economic times

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:58:00 PM IST","Meghana Malkan, Malkansview.com, says “there are two sectors that I would go by. One is the realty sector, the other is the pharma sector. Some kind of trade is being set in these two sectors. For example, when it comes to pharma, Zydus Lifescience is something I would be looking at. I will also be looking at Sun Pharma. Lupinis the third one.”.

Let us talk about the market. It is pretty quiet, isn't it? We have been consolidating for a while now. We have seen these sharper moves towards the day and otherwise. But what is your view? What are you making of the moves coming in the markets? Will we see a prolonged phase of consolidation after hitting new highs?
Meghana Malkan: Yes, we have been consolidating, but we are consolidating with the weakness at base. For example, if you talk about Nifty, I see very strong resistance coming at 22,200 and there are divergences on momentum indicators that makes Nifty on the weaker side. But where I see more weakness is in Bank Nifty. Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty and I believe it has a potential to go all the way down to 45,700. So, this is how I read both the indices.

But what do you make of the broader markets because they have been enjoying the party, they have been enjoying the ride and they have been outperforming the benchmark indices on most of the occasions. What is the trend that you are making out of the moves when it comes to the broader markets in particular?
Meghana Malkan: In particular, I believe there are these two sectors that I would go by. One is the realty sector, the other is the pharma sector. So, there is some kind of movement, some kind of trade that is being set in these two sectors. For example, when it comes to pharma, Zydus Lifescience is something I would be looking at. I will also be looking at Sun Pharma. So, these are the two stocks I will be looking at. Also, there is Lupin. It is a good short- to medium-term trade. If I enter right now, I can do that with a stop of say around Rs 775, which has the potential to go all the way up to Rs 840.

You also highlighted the realty sector and won’t not look at the PSU sector or do you think that everybody is giving it a break after the spectacular rally that the sector has seen?
Meghana Malkan: I would myself be taking it a break because considering the volume that is building up on the technical chart patterns and the way the momentum indicators are behaving, it calls for a break as of now. I will be focusing on these two sectors rather.

What do you make of the IT sector? Today, UBS has come out with a note, only on TCS, where they have upgraded the counter. They have hiked the targets. They are saying that maybe things are looking better for TCS, given the fact that they have bagged some big deals. But the IT sector can’t be painted with the same brush. What is your take?
Meghana Malkan: It is a kind of mixed bag. Some of them are weak. Some of them are showing quite an amount of strength in their technicals. If I see it from a higher time frame, I do not see a good chart pattern forming on any of them as of now. What I would do with this sector is really adopt a wait-and-watch approach. There are a few stocks that I am tracking at a few levels. Once these cross the resolution point, that could give me a better confirmation to go long on them.

ICICI Bank customer accuses manager of stealing Rs 16 crore from her FDs. Bank responds,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 06:29:00 PM IST","A Gurgaon woman has accused an ICICI Bank manager of embezzling Rs 16 crore from her account. This was reported by BBC. Shveta Sharma alleged that she transferred funds from her US account to ICICI Bank for fixed deposits, but the bank official created fake accounts, forged signatures, and obtained debit cards and cheque books in her name to withdraw money. The bank spokesperson acknowledged the fraud, emphasizing ICICI's reputation and commitment to punishment for those involved.

Sharma and her husband, who returned to India from the US and Hong Kong, deposited their life savings of around Rs 13.5 crore into the bank over four years from 2019 to 2023, according to the report, which would have now grown to Rs 16 crore. They opened a Non-Resident External (NRE) account on advice from a banker to take advantage of higher interest rates in India. Despite receiving receipts and regular statements, Sharma was shocked to discover in January that her fixed deposits had vanished.

""He gave me fake statements, created a fake email ID in my name and manipulated my mobile number in the bank records so I won't get any withdrawal notifications,"" she told the BBC.

Despite assurances from the bank, Sharma is still awaiting resolution. She has shared details with bank officials, spent days identifying fraudulent transactions, and lodged complaints with regulatory authorities and the police. The bank offered to deposit Rs 9.2 crore into her account pending investigation, but Sharma rejected it, stating it's insufficient and would freeze her account until the case is closed.

What ICICI Bank says
“We have communicated to the customer that we are ready to transfer the disputed amount of Rs 9.27 crore (she has already encashed a fixed deposit of Rs 2 crore) to her account with a lien, pending the outcome of the investigation,"" an ICICI Bank spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also pointed out that the bank ""has consistently sent transaction details to her registered mobile number and email id since the accounts were opened a few years ago. It is bewildering that the customer claims to be unaware of these transactions and balances in her account over the past three years, and she only recently noticed a discrepancy in her account balance. This discrepancy ought to have been observed by the customer when filing Income tax returns as well,"" the spokesperson said.

""She alleges that the mobile number and email ID of her account were changed without her knowledge. However, our records indicate that notifications regarding both changes were sent to her original mobile number and email address which were registered with the Bank. Furthermore, the new number is listed on the website of a company owned by the customer herself.""

ICICI Bank has lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EoW) of Delhi Police for a thorough investigation into the matter.

Another case involving ICICI Bank branch manager
ICICI Bank has made headlines for the wrong reasons twice this month alone. An ICICI Bank branch manager and his associates in Rajasthan successfully met business targets by withdrawing funds from unsuspecting account holders, creating a false impression of opening new FDs, current, and savings accounts. However, someone discovered the scheme and began blackmailing them, prompting further embezzlement from customers to pay off the blackmailer. Rajasthan Police confirmed about Rs 2.5 crore has been paid as hush money.

The branch manager and aides manipulated funds to meet performance targets, creating overdrafts against FDs to open new accounts, then closing them to return funds, a technique known as 'Entry and Reverse Entry'. The ICICI Bank spokesperson emphasized their commitment to investigating and ensuring no financial loss to genuine customers. Police formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the fraud, which involved freezing bank accounts and seizing cash and property. The scam was uncovered when an employee noticed missing funds in a friend's account, leading to police involvement and the exposure of the scheme. ICICI Bank promptly informed authorities of the scam after discovering irregularities.

NCLT approves Hinduja Group’s revival plan for Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:52:00 AM IST","The bankruptcy court in Mumbai allowed an application on Tuesday filed by the administrator of Reliance Capital to approve the Anil Ambani-promoted company’s acquisition by IndusInd International Holdings Ltd through the insolvency resolution process.

The division bench of Justice Virendra Singh Bisht and a technical member Prabhat Kumar approved the plan in an oral order. The detailed order is awaited.

Last year on June 29, the e-voting on resolution for approval of the resolution plan concluded, Reliance Capital’s Administrator Nageswara Rao Y said in a stock exchange announcement. However, he didn't disclose the financial details in the stock exchange announcement.

“This is one of the few big financial institutions which is getting resolved after DHFL and SREI under the code. On approval of the resolution plan, the claims of all the creditors and stakeholders shall be repaid in accordance with the approved resolution plan,” said Ashish Pyasi, Partner, Aendri Legal. “For the purpose of monitoring the plan implementation, a monitoring committee will be formed as per the plan so that there is no vacuum between the period of approval and the complete satisfaction of the terms of the plan.”

The order comes in the backdrop of the development wherein the veteran lawyer Shardul Shroff had approached the Supreme Court on behalf of Torrent Investments in October last year to speed up the hearing on the company's application to stay the second challenge mechanism in a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for the Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital.

At the heart of the dispute is a bid from the entity given 24 hours after the auction deadline (December 21, 2022), trumping the offer made within the stipulated time by Torrent Investments. Lenders decided to hold a second round of auction and that matter is pending before the Supreme Court.

While Torrent was the highest bidder offering Rs 8,640 crore in the first round, Hinduja offered Rs 9,660 crore in the second round. Torrent Investments, also in the fray for the distressed finance company, refrained from submitting a final plan to the lenders concerned.

In June, 99% of the lenders voted in favour of IIHL's plan. The administrator has admitted Rs 25,345 crore of claims from lenders as of June 8, 2023.

Now, Torrent Investments has challenged the view taken by NCLAT about Regulation 39 (1A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) that it does not restrict the rights of lenders to continue negotiation on financials and the decision to do a Second Challenge Mechanism even after its conclusion is not violative of Regulation 39(1A) of the CIRP Regulations.

As per Regulation 39(1A), the bidder must prepare a resolution plan in accordance with the bankruptcy code and submit the resolution plan to the RP within the time given in the invitation made by the RP or administrator in the current case.

In November 2019, the tribunal allowed an application to initiate an insolvency process against the debt-laden financier.",The economic times
"SC upholds demolition of Koyambedu mosque in Chennai, says unauthorised religious structures on public land must be removed","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:33:00 PM IST","In an important ruling, the Supreme Court of India has reiterated its stance on the removal of unauthorised religious structures constructed on public land, emphasizing the imperative for swift action by authorities nationwide. Upholding the demolition of Chennai's famous mosque in Koyambedu, SC says that unauthorised religious structures on public land can never be a venue for preaching religion. ""Move the mosque somewhere else, illegal encroachment in the name of religion will not be permitted, SC added.

The apex court, presided over by justices Surya Kant and KV Viswanathan, underscored the obligation of states and high courts to ensure the eradication of such encroachments, regardless of whether they are temples, churches, mosques, or gurdwaras.

The directive came in response to an appeal concerning a mosque unlawfully erected on public land in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The Madras High Court had previously ordered the removal of the mosque, a decision contested by the Hidaya Muslim Welfare Trust, represented by senior advocate S Nagamuthu.

Nagamuthu argued that the mosque posed no obstruction to the public and asserted that the trust had legally acquired the land. However, the court pointed out that the land was under the jurisdiction of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and that the construction had been undertaken without proper authorization.

Despite receiving a stop work notice from local authorities in 2020, the trust proceeded with the construction, prompting the Supreme Court to question the legitimacy of their actions.

""We are very clear...whether it’s a temple or a mosque, there cannot be unauthorised constructions,"" remarked the bench.

Ultimately, the court upheld the decision of the Madras High Court, affirming that the petitioner had no legal claim to the land and had proceeded with the construction unlawfully.

This ruling is in line with previous directives issued by the Supreme Court between 2009 and 2018, aimed at preventing the proliferation of unauthorised religious structures on public land. States and Union territories have been instructed to assess existing constructions on a case-by-case basis and take appropriate measures.

McDonald's cheese crackdown: Maharashtra to inspect global fast-food chains,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:24:00 PM IST","After finding misleading claims related to the use of substitutes instead of real cheese in burgers and nuggets at a McDonald's outlet last week, the state of Maharashtra will be inspecting outlets of all global fast-food chains for food regulation violations, Reuters reported citing an official.

The Indian state will run a check for misleading promotion of non-cheese items as containing cheese after mcdonald's crackdown and also inspect all McDonald's outlets in Maharashtra for the same, widening its scrutiny post crackdown by the state's Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

""We are planning to check all outlets of McDonald's,"" Abhimanyu Kale, the FDA chief told Reuters. ""We will also take action on other well-known and frequently visited global fast-food chain outlets,"" he added, but declined to identify the brands being targeted.

Saurabh Kalra, MD of Westlife, which runs McDonald's in west and south India, said that the company will welcome any inspections and maintains the ""highest standards"".

Shares of the company fell to Rs 762 when the news broke out, eventually recovering later.

The FDA had suspended the licence of a McDonald's outlet in Ahmednagar, leading the chain to remove the term ""cheese"" from various items. The licence was, however, revoked later.

The regulator alleged that McDonald's used cheese analogues without proper disclosure, misleading consumers into thinking they were consuming real cheese. The state FDA has also pushed the chain to implement corrective actions statewide and possibly nationally.

On the crackdown, Westlife Foodworld had issued a clarification last week saying that it is actively engaging with the competent authorities on this issue and awaiting their final clarification.

""We have always been adhering to stringent food standards and are fully compliant with all applicable food laws. Our commitment to transparency in our ingredients and dedication to providing delicious, high-quality meals to our customers remains unwavering,"" the company said.

"Bullish on EMS stocks; Dixon may even cross Rs 10,000: Sanjiv Bhasin","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:19:00 AM IST","Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says still thinks consumer names are going to outperform, at least in the near to six months. “We think if you have to take off some chips, take it off the momentum plays. Dixon is still one of our top holdings, and we continue to be very, very bullish on that spadce.”

Let’s start with the consumer durable space. Havells is one stock which has not moved much and has not corrected either. On Whirlpool, there was fresh commentary from the global CEO talking about the reason for offloading some stake in the Indian business. And the reason they gave was that the stock trades at an expensive valuation. They expect the valuation to come down. They clearly saw asset arbitrage. Is this space a bit heated up?
Sanjiv Bhasin: You have very marquee names that have gained market share. Even though the unorganised sector exists, Voltas, Havells and say Crompton, are really the ones which are the big players. Yes, Whirlpool in the white goods is a very expensive stock. But it has always been a brand which has been admired. It is like a D-Mart or an Asian Paints. This is a very sweet spot given that middle incomes are now rising and you have seen that across the board, there are no coolers. Everyone wants air conditioners and the advent of LED and the whole gamut of appliances which all these companies have, have been stellar performers.

Voltas, also on the back of that Middle East cooling tower business, which generates about 20% of their revenue, has been in a sweet spot. Tata Group chairman N Chandra indicated that their consumer-facing arm is going to get more mileage from them. Voltas, as a disclosure, in June at Rs 750, was my top buy. And we own both Voltas and Havells from much lower level Rs 995-1000 on Havells. They may have not performed, but that is in line because everyone has been avoiding the consumer's side of the market.

I think rural incomes are rising and consumers are going to be the next play given the advent of preference for bigger names and brands. That is why we suggested Bata and Patanjali. But I would definitely advocate a buy on Havells. As a disclosure, both Havells and Voltas have been in our portfolio. Voltas has been a total outperformer and Havells has been a very lukewarm performance. But given the type of businesses they have and the performance of Lloyds now after the merger, they are in everything over there as far as consumer appliances go.

Have to ask you about Patym. Considering you were the patient one, still invested in the stock, what have you made of the latest move by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, messaging to the regulator that he is dissociating himself from Paytm Payments Bank by stepping down?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Finally, the ego is being let loose and they are realising that they have to think of the bigger good. It is the case like in Zee the Goenkas do not want to let go despite having only 3% stake. At least, Vijay Shekhar has made the right move in the broader perspective.

Now, we are aware that there may have been the KYC issues and they have denied any no money laundering because they do not have a foreign exchange licence. So, it will set to rest any other speculation and now with the change in the governing body, it will give a better image of the Payment Bank. It will give them time and all is in the domain of the regulator. They will wait for the report of the ED and other things for which I think they have been absolved of a lot of things. So, it is a matter of time.

On the other hand, the way they have gone about increasing the number of banks where they can share and that at least puts the business back on track. Yes, the margins and the accretives will see a little bit of a hit but we still think the longer term story of Paytm is very, very strong. We are staying put. We will wait for more. Only thing, this adds more weight on the side that now the governing body will have more teeth and at least there will be a unanimous board of directors who are more appreciated by the central bank and by the regulators.

That is what I have made out of it. Rest we will see but I still think the stock is going to see volatility. We would recommend that let it stabilise, let these things die down and then you can take your call.

Yeah, and volatility is something which will be there in Vodafone and Indus Towers as well. How should one approach the telecom sector now?
Sanjiv Bhasin: It was a scream at Rs 11 and at Rs 205. Both those stocks are in our portfolio. We think that this is a very sweet spot for the turn of things. The receivables from Vodafone means Indus is in a very sweet spot. They have already made provisions in case there is any write back. Their margins last quarter were the strongest. I still think Rs 275 is attainable in Indus and rightly so. We will wait for the Rs 2000 crore which the promoter has raised to be there and the guideline.

But the bigger thing will be if they do get some foreign player or a foreign investor to pump it. They need more money on the 5G side. Their ARPUs are growing and we realise they are there. Whether you can say 2.5 players or 2.75 players, they are still half of 0.75 and on a Rs 11,000 crore turnover they did an EBITDA of Rs 4,500 crore. I think they are there to survive but the debt overhang will constantly remain as something to be addressed till they raise more capital. Let us wait and watch what the capital raising is. Indus Tower definitely is a bigger gainer because of the capital infusion.

What about the PSU banking names? Of course, a lot of them have run up? Are there any select names that you would still recommend as buy?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I would say that everything in the AB stable is doing well, AB Capital. Now, look at a stock called ABSL AMC. I have been bullish on that all the way from 400-425 level, and it has underperformed. But asset management companies are here for the next 20-30 years. I am just giving a call. It is in our portfolio. We have a very good long-term view on it.

But at Rs 500, it has just given a fresh breakout. It has hit a new two-year high. ABSL AMC in this stable is a very sweet spot to be in, given that it has the holding company of the AMC, it has AIF, it has insurance, and all put together that stock can be a real outperformer from here. I do not rule out 650 coming in the next three to six months.

Rather than the PSU banks, I would be more overweight on the private banks; ICICI, HDFC, Axis, Kotak that is where more delta will be gained over the next few months. But in the meantime, we still think SBI stands out. The rest, we will not chase. We have booked profit across the board in some of them and are turning our preference towards largecap private banks.

How much more damage do you foresee for Asian Paints before it prices in another strong player in the market, namely Grasim?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Well, first to Dixon Technology, that is one of our top holdings all the way from Rs 3,700 and we have no intention to get worried by CLSA and Jefferies. At Rs 7,000, when a stock has gone from 35 to 7, there will be ups and downgrades, but stay the course. EMS is here for the time to come. We think Dixon finally will even cross Rs 10,000. Look at the language of the management, look at the performance, look at the data which speaks for itself.

But like we said, there is an opportunity to buy and sell. I still think any decline in Dixon is a buying opportunity. Same is the case with Asian Paints. We saw the same downgrade for Eicher when Harley was launched for Hero and Triumph for Bajaj. After a couple of weak days, the stock bounced back purely on the back of Royal Enfield, only gaining market share. Asian Paints deserves to be done by a SIP.

Let the initial flurry of downgrade get over with, but that is a brokerage call. On the underlying business, it will take miles before Grasim can dent into the market share. It will be a little threat, but the pie is big enough for all to survive and Asian Paints to grow. We continue to think consumer names are going to outperform, at least in the near to six months. We think if you have to take some chips, take it off the momentum plays. So Dixon is still one of our top holdings, and we continue to be very, very bullish on that spade.

Asian Paints is something which we have not that much exposure, but we think we will add closer to that target, which most have given, which may not come in the near term, but this is one blue chip along with HDFC which you must have in your portfolio.

Gaganyaan: Why test pilots are best suited for first mission,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:26 IST","BENGALURU: Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Gaganyaan — India’s first human spaceflight mission — on August 15, 2018, speculation was rife about who the potential astronauts could be and civilians, including women, had not been ruled out.
Although Isro was initially looking at all probable candidates for the first mission, TOI, within months of the PM’s announcement, learnt and reported that all astronauts that will be part of the first crewed mission would be test pilots from the Indian Air Force (IAF), something both Isro and IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) which was responsible for the selection confirmed later.

Meet India's four astronauts selected for ISRO's Gaganyaan Mission

“It’s quite straightforward because space technology is essentially an extension of aviation. And test pilots, by virtue of their specialisations, have always been called upon to study deeply all that can probably go wrong in something that has not been tried before,” Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut, had told TOI earlier.

“...That gives them the edge as they are experienced in preparing themselves better. Also, in case things do not go as per planned, their specialisation and experience kicks-in and helps them analyse the situation. This makes them the natural choice,” he added.
Former IAF test pilot Wing Commander KT Sebastian had said that most pilots start test-flying when they are about 28 years old. “They are both physiologically and psychologically trained to adapt to situations that a space flight demands. Having flown different types of aircraft, they are quick to acquaint themselves with new systems. They are also accustomed to various types of pressures and operating against gravity because all test pilots other than those testing choppers, are from the fighter stream,” Sebastian had said.

Others that TOI spoke with said test pilots were best suited to also diagnose failures quickly and execute commands from control stations.
Globally too a majority of all astronauts have been test pilots. Therefore, it wasn’t a surprise when India selected four test pilots — Group Captains Prashanth Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Prathap and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla, who were bestowed with astronaut wings by PM Modi on Tuesday — were selected.
The four men, who have completed the first semester of their India module at the astronaut training centre in Bengaluru after they finished their initial training in Russia are under continuous training, will continue their mission-specific crew training.

Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi lost the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh, where his party is in power, to BJP's Harsh Mahajan. The Congress said the nine MLAs cross-voted in the elections.
Both the candidates bagged 34 votes each after which the BJP leader was declared winner by draw of lots.

""I extend heartiest congratulations to Harsh Mahajan, he has won. He deserves my congratulations. I would like to tell his party - introspect and think. When a 25-member party fields a candidate against a 43-member party, there is just one message -- we will shamelessly do that which is not permitted by the law,"" Abhishek Singhvi said while speaking to reporters.

""I would also like to thank the nine persons (MLAs) because they have taught me a lot about human nature, its fickleness or its resoluteness. They supped with us...So, I think we are bad judges of human character, they are obviously better judges of human character,"" he added.
It is a major jolt for the Congress which has 40 MLAs in the 68-member state assembly and claimed support of the independents. The result made it clear that nine MLAs voted in favour of the BJP which was confident that Congress MLAs would exercise 'conscience vote'.
Polling was held for 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, four in Karnataka and one seat in Himachal Pradesh. On February 20, 41 candidates including BJP chief J P Nadda, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and L Murugan were elected unopposed to the Upper House.

"Elon Musk raises his Microsoft 'customer care' complaint directly to Satya Nadella, here's what he said","Feb 27, 2024, 16:23 IST","Clearly the text didn’t seem to have worked. Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

All 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.
There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.
Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

'Congress government may topple in Himachal'
Earlier in the day, Himachal Pradesh Leader of Opposition and BJP leader Jairam Thakur had claimed that the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government is in a minority in the state.
When asked if the state BJP would demand a floor test, Thakur said, ""The budget will be presented on Wednesday. We will discuss the budget and then we will see the situation. But I can see that the government has lost the majority.""

"Narendra Modi flays DMK and Congress, praises MGR and Jayalalithaa","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:36 IST","PALLADAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at DMK and Congress on Tuesday but heaped praises on AIADMK icons MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa signalling that BJP was keeping the option of allying with AIADMK open.
Speaking at the valedictory meeting of BJP state president K Annamalai’s ‘En Mann En Makkal’ padayatra at Madappur near Palladam in Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur district, Modi said MGR was lauded as an incomparable leader by the people of TN because he had given good education and public health.

“He came to power through good deeds, not through dynasty. But the DMK is insulting him today,’’ Modi said, noting that he visited MGR’s place of birth in Sri Lanka during his recent trip to the island nation.
“After MGR, it was `Amma’ Jayalalithaa who gave good governance in Tamil Nadu,’’ the PM said. “She dedicated her entire life for the people of TN. I pay her my tributes. It was because of her service that she lives in the heart of Tamil Nadu people even today,’’ Modi said.

Modi’s speech comes in the backdrop of a shadow boxing between Tamil Nadu BJP and its erstwhile ally AIADMK attempting to poach leaders from each other.
Ever since AIADMK walked out of NDA in September last year, the BJP could not lure any major political parties into its fold in Tamil Nadu, except Tamil Maanila Congress, a light weight in the state. AIADMK has clarified that it will not patch up with BJP again. BJP for its part has begun stitching its own alliance in the state.

Modi’s remarks indicate that the saffron party keeps its option open for an AIADMK alliance.
Hitting out at DMK and Congress, Modi said the fate of INDIA front was sealed in Delhi. But the opposition front was trying to stay alive in TN to “to loot people in TN,” he said.
“It is time to lock their shop which has been opened to loot people,” he said. The right lock meant to shut the DMK – Congress shop has been created using the `En Mann En Makkal’ yatra, he said.
Listing out the welfare programmes -- including two defence corridors -- the BJP-led central government has implemented in TN, he asked if the Congress would implement such development schemes if it came to power. “Will those who received bribes to procure weapons allow development of defence corridors here?’’ he asked.
Modi said BJP had always prioritised growth of TN. “We have given more to TN in the last ten years than what the DMK-Congress alliance had given between 2004 and 2014,” he said. Hence, BJP has captured the hearts of people in TN, though the party was never in power in the state.
That was the reason, those who were looting TN for years are spreading lies, creating confusion and dividing people to hold on to power. “Their drama, however, has been exposed. Their corruption is being brought to light everyday,” he said in an apparent reference to corruption cases against DMK ministers.
Modi said BJP has emerged as a force to reckon with in TN and the party would create history in 2024.
BJP’s allies G K Vasan, A C Shanmugam and Devanathan Yadav were present on the stage along with BJP leaders L Murugan and K Annamalai in the public meeting touted as a biggest show of strength by BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
Modi who landed at Sulur Air Force base in Coimbatore took a chopper to reach the meeting venue. From the helipad he came to the stage, designed like a lotus, on an open jeep waving to the crowd amidst slogans `Vendum Modi, Meendum Modi.’
The yatra inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah in Rameswaram in June last year covered all the assembly constituencies.

"Smriti Mandhana blitz, disciplined bowlers power RCB to 8-wicket win over Gujarat Giants in WPL","Feb 27, 2024, 22:44 IST","NEW DELHI: Skipper Smriti Mandhana's explosive innings and a disciplined bowling performance led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a convincing eight-wicket victory over the struggling Gujarat Giants in their Women's Premier League (WPL) clash in Bengaluru on Tuesday.
Chasing a target of 108 runs, RCB's Mandhana (43, 27 balls, 8x4, 1x6) and S Meghana (36, 28 balls, 5x4, 1x6) formed a solid partnership of 40 runs for the second wicket, effortlessly achieving the target in just 12.3 overs.
This win marked RCB's second consecutive victory in the WPL.

RCB's success was built upon the excellent foundation laid by their bowlers, with pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) and left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux (3/25) being the standout performers after the team opted to bowl. The Giants struggled to post a competitive total, managing only 107 for 7.

Mandhana set the tone for RCB's chase with a powerful start, smashing two fours in the first two balls off pacer Lea Tahuhu. The left-hander's aggressive innings included a well-timed pull and a six over the head of Tahuhu, contributing to RCB amassing 13 runs in the opening over.

Despite losing Sophine Devine in the fourth over, Mandhana continued her onslaught. Although she missed out on a fifty, her entertaining innings highlighted the contrast with the Giants' earlier struggles on the same pitch.

The Giants' captain Beth Mooney (8) fell victim to Renuka's strategic change in line, while Phoebe Litchfield was stumped by Richa Ghosh. Renuka, bowling her full quota of four overs, concluded with impressive figures of 4-0-14-2.

The Giants faced continuous setbacks, losing key wickets, including that of Ashleigh Gardner, hindering their efforts to boost the innings. Dayalan Hemalatha's unbeaten 31 off 25 balls helped the Giants reach just beyond the 100-run mark.
RCB bowlers maintained control throughout the innings, limiting the Giants to only 10 fours and two sixes, underscoring the difficulty the Giants encountered on the field.

The organisation is found continuing its activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty of the nation,” home minister Amit Shah shared in a post on X.
Recalling that the outfit was first declared an ‘unlawful association’ on February 28, 2019, Shah warned that “anyone threatening the security of the nation will face ruthless measures”.
MHA, in its gazette notification extending the ban, referred to a long list of cases against JeI and their leadership/cadres, including the NIA case relating to collection of funds by the outfit for use in encouraging violent and secessionist activities. As per NIA chargesheet, the funds were used by the operatives of terrorist outfits including Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashker e Taiba to organise protests and spread public unrest and communal disharmony.

The ongoing debate between club and country has been fueled by the emergence of the IPL, and Rohit's firm stance on the matter coincided with established players like Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan ignoring a BCCI directive to participate in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, choosing instead to concentrate on their IPL preparations.


""Jin logon ko bhookh hai, hum unhi logon ko mauka denge (We will give opportunities to only those who are hungry),"" Rohit declared on Monday after a series-clinching win over England in the fourth Test in Ranchi.

""Agar hunger nahi hai to unko khila ke koi matlab nahi hai (There's no point in playing those who don't have the hunger),"" he said.
The hunger that Rohit emphasised was evident in emerging talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep, and the more established Shubman Gill, all of whom showcased their skills at different points in the series against England.
However, Rohit underscored the issue regarding unnamed individuals who appear to lack that passionate drive and determination.

""I concur with the Indian captain. There should be hunger in younger cricketers to play the longest format,"" Abhilash Khandekar, president of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association, told PTI.
It is for those that the BCCI issued a directive earlier this month asking centrally-contracted cricketers to be available for Ranji engagements.
Several representatives from state associations admitted that Rohit was not off the mark when he said those who are not up for it should not be considered for the toughest format. But they also feel that a system needs to be in place so that such a situation never arises.

""Ranji Trophy cannot be taken lightly by any player, it is the backbone of Indian cricket. It is the most important tournament in domestic cricket. This should be followed up in other formats in domestic cricket,"" Khandekar said.
Another official, who did not wish to be named, went to the extent of saying that Ranji Trophy ran the risk of ""a slow death if it was not made mandatory for top players to compete.""
State units see the parent body's move as a case of better late than never.
""I complement BCCI for this decision of compelling players to play for their state in Ranji Trophy. I see it as a case of better late than never, this is going to help domestic cricket in a big way,"" said Khandekar.
In the recent past, the Indian batters have been found vulnerable on turning tracks at home.
Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar believes if elite players turn up for their respective states in Ranji Trophy whenever available, it would only make them better players of spin.
""Playing Ranji is very important. It helps you play spin better on Indian wickets, your overall skills are improved. And when you play foreign teams, it becomes easier (to face spin),"" said Vengsarkar, himself a great player of spin.
""I feel it is a player's wish whether to play Ranji or not. If he doesn't want to play, we have enough in India to choose from, they will play and establish themselves. No one is bigger than the game. No one is indispensable,"" he said.
In Kishan's absence from the ongoing series, Dhruv Jurel made the most of the opportunity by coming up with two brilliant under-pressure knocks in only his second Test.
Like the MPCA chief, a state unit official proposed another step to rein in players who ignore red-ball cricket.
""This was a much needed step and should have been taken earlier. If an India player is regularly featuring in Ranji Trophy, it acts a massive motivator to the younger players in the squad.
""I would also want the BCCI to empower state units to ban those players who don't play Ranji Trophy. If a senior is dropped for once, the juniors would not dare to ignore their red ball commitments for T20 cricket,"" said a state unit official requesting anonymity.

"Rajya Sabha polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP one in Karnataka","Feb 27, 2024, 19:12 IST","NEW DELHI: In a major win for the ruling Congress, all three of its Rajya Sabha candidates secured the requisite number of votes to win their respective seats from Karnataka, after one BJP MLA cross-voted for the ruling party and another abstained.
Karnataka deputy chief minister D.K. Shivakumar said: ""This shows the unity and integrity of Congress. I thank all the MLAs, party workers and the media.
I'm very happy to inform you that all Congress candidates have won. I thank all voters, CM and party workers and the AICC President also. I would like to thank Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge.""
Congress candidates Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken won with 47 votes, while G C Chandrashekhar secured 45 votes.
The BJP won 1 Rajya Sabha seat from the state with candidate Narayansa Bhandage securing 47 votes. The BJP-JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy lost the polls.

Each Rajya Sabha candidate needed at least 45 votes in the 224-MLA Karnataka Assembly to win a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. With 135 MLAs, the Congress had the exact number to elect its three candidates.
The BJP has 66 MLAs, which secured a comfortable win for party worker Narayansa Bhandage.
The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members -- Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar (BJP) and Congress's G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah.

Two BJP MLAs cross-vote
In a setback to the BJP-JD(S) alliance, saffron party MLA S T Somashekar voted for Maken while MLA Arbail Shivaram Hebbar abstained from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections for the four seats in Karnataka on Tuesday.
Somashekar represents Yashwantpur assembly constituency and Hebbar the Yellapur segment.
Leader of Opposition R Ashoka said they would seek action against Somashekhar, and termed the MLA's decision ""political suicide"".
Soon after voting, Somashekar told reporters that he voted as per his conscience. ""I went by my conscience and voted for those who worked for building schools and carry out development works in my constituency,"" the rebel BJP leader said.
Ashoka said Hebbar had been in touch with him since morning and assured him that he would vote for the BJP candidate.
""Hebbar had been telling me that he would not betray the party, but I don't know why he did not turn up to vote. He double-crossed us today, which he should not have done. We will initiate action against him,"" Ashoka said.
Both the MLAs had defected from Congress to the BJP along with 15 others, bringing down the 14-month-old coalition government of the Congress and the JD(S) in 2019 facilitating the installation of the BJP government.
In 2023, they once again got elected to the assembly on the BJP ticket.

"Forget your chargers: This 28,000mAh power bank doubles up as an Android phone","Feb 27, 2024, 12:32 IST","Energizer has revealed its newest phone, the Hard Case P28K, boasting an incredibly large 28,000mAh battery alongside a rugged, durable design. Unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona this week, the phone promises exceptional battery life for off-the-grid use while travelling or in areas with unreliable power.
With its massive internal battery, Energizer claims the P28K can last up to a whole week on a single charge with typical usage.
Talk time reaches an astounding 122 hours continuously, while standby time is pegged at a staggering 94 days by the company. Despite the size, Avenir Telecom, maker of Energizer phones, states the battery can still be replenished from 0% to 100% in around 1.5 hours.
However, such an enormous battery comes with its own drawbacks. Weighing in at 570 grams, the phone is weighty compared to conventional smartphones. At nearly 28mm thick, it is also more than triple the thickness of standard phones on shelves currently. However, the phone is at least durable, or that's what Energizer markets it as, thanks to an IP69 rating for dust and water protection.
Beyond a power bank - A look at the phone’s specs
Inside, the Hard Case P28K is equipped like a basic smartphone, with entry-level specs that include a MediaTek Helio G99 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, and a 6.78” 1080p LCD. It ships running Android 14 software. Cameras are led by a 64MP main sensor and accompanied by a 20MP ultrawide and 16MP selfie camera.

Priced at €250 in Europe, the phone won’t officially launch until October. Unfortunately for customers in other regions, Avenir Telecom says it has no plans to sell the phone outside of Europe for now.
Energizer has also made headlines with past concepts for phones with similarly giant batteries, though those devices ultimately never materialised as real products brought to market. Four years ago, at the MWC, Avenir showcased another concept – another Android phone with an 18,000mAh battery. Then, two years before that, the company showed off another phone that had a 16,000mAh battery.

India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.

A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India

The role of body image and self-esteem in the development and recovery from eating disorders,"Feb 27, 2024, 19:23 IST","Eating disorders affect an estimated 2-3% of the population worldwide, predominantly women. In fact, conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder are not just medical terms; they are also lived experiences deeply intertwined with how individuals perceive their bodies and value themselves.
In the last few years, the term ""body image"" has woven itself into the fabric of our daily conversations, yet its profound impact on eating disorders remains underexplored.
But, can negative body image trigger these conditions? Are issues of self-worth at the core of every eating disorder?
The answers are multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of this issue. Today, we'll explore how societal acceptance, or the lack thereof, shapes our body image and self-esteem, setting the stage for a discussion on the pivotal role these factors play in both the onset and recovery from eating disorders.
We unravel the layers of this critical topic, aiming to foster understanding and compassion towards those affected.

Self-esteem reflects our own valuation of ourselves. Possessing high self-esteem typically means we feel positively about our inner and outer selves. Low self-esteem can make us doubt ourselves and look for ways to improve how we feel, sometimes focusing too much on our appearance.
Body Image is how we see our physical selves and what we think about that. If we like what we see in the mirror, we have a positive body image. If we don't like what we see, our body image is negative. This doesn't just influence how we dress or carry ourselves; it deeply affects our inner world.

Eating Behavior is how we eat, which includes what, when, and why we eat. This can range from healthy, regular meals to unhealthy patterns like eating too much, too little, or in a way that doesn't give our body what it needs.
How They Connect:

Imagine your mind is a seesaw. On one side, you have self-esteem, and on the other, you have body image. When both sides are balanced, the seesaw stays level — this balance leads to healthy eating behaviors. However, if one side is too heavy (like if we have really low self-esteem or a very negative body image), the seesaw tips. This imbalance can lead us to develop unhealthy eating behaviors as a way to try to ""fix"" whatever we think is wrong.
The Science, Made Simple:

The Beginning: It may start innocently: someone feeling they're a bit overweight and decide it's time for a change. With an initial goal to lose weight, they begin to restrict their eating. This stage is crucial because it's where the seeds of an eating disorder can be sown, although the individual's intentions are to improve their health and appearance.
The Mind's Role: As the weight starts to come off, there's a noticeable boost in body image. Compliments flow in, reinforcing the behavior. This is where the mind plays a pivotal role. The positive feedback loop - weight loss leading to compliments, leading to further restriction - can alter perception. The original weight loss goal shifts; what was once enough no longer satisfies. Deviation from restrictive dietary behavior may then fuel the feeling of guilt, which may also lead them to self-induced purging. This dissatisfaction fuels a distorted self-image.
Image: Canva

The mind becomes preoccupied with controlling food intake, where eating something considered ""bad"" or missing an exercise session triggers anxiety or fear. This is a hallmark of how low self-esteem and poor body image begin to warp the individual's relationship with food and their body.
The Body's Response: Physically, the body responds to these changes in diet and exercise in several ways. Initially, weight loss might improve certain health markers, but as restriction continues, the body enters a state of stress. Nutrient deficiencies can develop due to restrictions or purging, metabolism may slow down, and physical health can deteriorate. The body, in an effort to conserve energy, can reduce the resources allocated to non-essential functions, affecting everything from hormonal balance to bone density.
The Cycle of Eating Disorders: The cycle that ensues is driven by a complex interaction between mental and physical health. The brain, fixated on controlling food and weight, can push the body further into malnutrition. This obsession with food and fear of gaining weight can lead to conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.
The Mental Struggle: Psychologically, the person becomes trapped in a cycle of negative self-talk, where their self-worth is intrinsically linked to their body image and ability to control their eating. This cycle is self-perpetuating; the more the individual strives to control their diet to improve their self-esteem and body image, the more entrenched the eating disorder becomes. Anxiety, depression, and isolation can follow, making recovery more challenging.

Breaking the Cycle

Recovery involves addressing both the mental and physical aspects of the disorder. It's about relearning healthy eating habits, yes, but also about rebuilding self-esteem and developing a positive body image that isn't tied to weight or food. Psychotherapy, nutritional counseling, and support groups are often key components of a successful recovery strategy.
Psychotherapy: Some therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or Existential therapy, are central to treating eating disorders. It helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors related to their eating habits, body image, and self-esteem.
Through therapy, patients learn coping strategies to manage distressing emotions and thoughts without resorting to unhealthy eating behaviors.
Nutritional Counseling: Nutritional counseling is provided by dietitians specialized in eating disorders. It aims to restore healthy eating patterns and address misconceptions about food and diet. Nutritional counseling educates individuals on the importance of balanced nutrition and helps them develop a peaceful relationship with food.
It involves creating personalized meal plans that ensure the body receives the nutrients it needs for recovery, while also respecting the patient's likes and dislikes, gradually reintroducing feared foods, and teaching portion control.
Embracing self-compassion, limiting social media, engaging in physical activity, surrounding yourself with positivity, and challenging negative thoughts are crucial steps towards improving self-esteem and body image.
These strategies not only foster a healthier relationship with food but also pave the way for a fulfilling, balanced life. Remember, the journey to self-love and acceptance is ongoing, filled with small yet significant victories.

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.

Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam. The aspirants from rural areas are not likely to face difficulty as all facilities are available in every nook and corner,” says Pathak.
The Commission said that the name of the candidate and the date on which the photograph was taken must also be mentioned clearly on the photograph. The faces of the candidates should also occupy three-fourths of the space in the photograph, the official notification said.
The Commission has also asked the candidates to make sure that their appearance matches their photograph at each stage of the examination process – Preliminary, Mains (written) and Interview or Personality test. For instance, if a candidate uploads a bearded photograph, he must appear with the same look in the Preliminary, Mains (Written) and Interview/Personality Test. Same would be the case with spectacles, moustaches, etc.
Candidates who wish to apply for the Civil Service Examination=Preliminary 2024 for about 1,056 vacant posts, can visit the official website at upsc.gov.in and submit the application form. Candidates scoring above the cut-off marks in CSE prelims will become eligible to register for the main examination. The mains will be descriptive and will be conducted from September 20 for five days.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. runs McDonald's in western India and South India. operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.

However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a fiscal deficit target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.

The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

The states have so far drawn down 31.5 per cent more debt this fiscal at Rs 8.143 lakh crore as against Rs 6.193 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:16:00 PM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.

“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Mizuho courting India elite shows Japan banks’ global ambition,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:24:00 PM IST","Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s showcase of its business ties at Mumbai’s luxury St Regis hotel this month underscored its growing foothold in India, a market that has lately been endorsed by Wall Street giants.

An awards ceremony to fete financial professionals drew more than 150 executives from companies, including those backed by the country’s richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, according to people familiar with the matter. The Japanese bank hosted the event that’s now in its second year to build closer ties with the business community. It came as Mizuho announced its biggest-ever acquisition in India.

Mizuho’s celebration with its biggest clients also underscores inroads made by Japan megabanks in the world’s most populous country as global banks look for alternatives to China. They’ve vaulted to become the country’s largest arrangers of offshore loans, tapping into the appetite of tycoons to grow their empire. When the Adani Group sought to tout its deep bank ties last year in its rebuttal against short seller Hindenburg Research’s allegations, the Japanese lenders surfaced on the list as major backers in Asia.

“Japanese banks are increasingly gaining clout in India due to their competitive rates for credit facilities, a factor that American lenders envy,” said Srinath Sridharan, an independent policy researcher and corporate advisor. He warned however that if banks try to chase down loan pricing in a competitive market, this may trigger margin pressures and an under-estimation of underwriting risks.

Mizuho’s bigger Japanese peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rank among the top arrangers of Indian offshore loans in the last few years. They were toppled by HSBC Holdings Plc. last year. Notably, the Wall Street banks so far have rarely featured highly in these league tables.

Major US banks may be more constrained by concerns over backlash from their shareholders on their lending relationships, especially those that are in the spotlight for negative news, people familiar with the matter said.

Mizuho’s loan portfolio has shifted from lending largely to government entities to backing large Indian companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing strategic information.

The bank hired Piyush Agarwal from HSBC in 2019 where he was previously head of large local corporates in India. It has also tapped several senior client coverage bankers from other rivals to help expand its customer base, the people said, helping it forge lending ties with Reliance, JSW Group and Tata Group companies.

“India’s potential is not limited to its population,” a Mizuho spokesman said in response to queries from Bloomberg News. “Multiple factors are behind its potential: English being its official second language, plenty of math and IT talents, geographic advantage being in the middle of Indian Ocean, connecting Asia and Western Europe.” He said the bank plans to further grow in the country, without elaborating.

Bloomberg

At Japan’s biggest bank MUFG, Shashank Joshi, deputy chief executive officer in India, is seen as the key driver for its business in the country, helping to form bridges with the most important companies and local lenders. During the throes of Adani’s Hindenburg crisis for example, MUFG was among lenders that facilitated roadshows across the world as the conglomerate sought to win back investor trust.

MUFG CEO Hironori Kamezawa told Bloomberg News in an interview last year that India’s appeal is rising in comparison with China, and the bank continues to push growth there.

At Sumitomo Mitsui, its new CEO Toru Nakashima said Japan’s second-largest lender is mulling how to become more of a full-fledged financial player in India.

The banks didn’t elaborate further on their ambitions.

Chief business officer Rakesh Garg who joined Sumitomo Mitsui from Barclays Plc after more than 15 years at the British firm has been working to expand the client base and is also focusing on green financing, the people said. Sandeep Chopra, a veteran banker who was most recently at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., joined the bank in December to head its corporate coverage.

“Familiarity and success in the Indian market further incentivize Japanese banks to expand their operations in India,” said Sridharan.

Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.




The Dow led lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

At 09:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.05 points, or 0.26%, at 38,967.18, the S&P 500 was down 2.79 points, or 0.06%, at 5,066.74, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.59 points, or 0.05%, at 15,967.67.


European shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in basic resources stocks and a string of upbeat earnings, while investors and central bankers braced for inflation data this week that could alter the course for interest rates.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ticked up 0.1% by 9:35 GMT, while Germany's benchmark DAX climbed 0.4%, logging another record high.

Investors are taking a pause after last week's surge in artificial intelligence-driven buying which propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high.


In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.


CMS Infosystems (Rs 1,684 crore), General Insurance (Rs 1,179 crore), Vodafone Idea (Rs 187 crore), IREDA (Rs 174 crore) were among the most active stocks on BSE in value terms.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

"Rajya Sabha Elections: ""CRPF, Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 Congress MLAs,"" Himachal CM Sukhvinder Sukhu","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:37:00 PM IST","As counting for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh is underway, state Chief Minister Sukhvinder Sukhu on Tuesday alleged that CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away five to six Congress MLAs and urged the Himachal BJP leaders to have patience and not to threaten polling officers.

""The manner in which the counting has begun and Opposition leaders are threatening the polling officers again and again is not right for democracy...They had halted the counting for long. I urge the Himachal BJP unit leaders to have patience, don't put pressure on people...CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 MLAs,"" CM Sukhu told reporters on Tuesday.

He further said that, ""I can say that the people who have gone away are being contacted by their families, I urge them to contact their families...There is no need to worry.""

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

"Rajya Sabha Polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP bags one in Karnataka","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:24:00 PM IST","In a closely contested electoral battle in Karnataka, all three Congress candidates emerged victorious. The three candidates- Ajay Maken, Dr. Syed Naseer Hussain, and GC Chandrashekhar- secured wins with slender margins, receiving 47, 46, and 46 votes respectively.

Voting in the elections for the four Rajya Sabha seats in Karnataka began Tuesday at 9 am. The counting began at 5pm.

The Congress had 133 MLAs, the BJP has 66, JD (S) 19, while others account for four.

Of the four others, the Congress claimed the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and was confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.

The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members - Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP and G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah from the Congress.

The Congress, which was confident of winning three seats had fielded G C Chandrashekhar, Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken.

The BJP had fielded Narayansa Bhandage as also JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy as the NDA candidate which had made the election interesting.

Congress sources claimed that the party has the support of four others, reported PTI.

""Besides, we may get three votes from the rival camp,"" a top Congress source told PTI.

Fearing cross-voting, the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance huddled their MLAs in a private resort on Monday.

They also conducted a workshop for the new members to inform them about the election process and how to cast their votes.

All parties have issued whips to the MLAs, who are the voters in Tuesday's poll, amid apprehensions of cross-voting.

According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, the preference votes kick in.

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

The step was taken in order to develop the onshore rupee non-deliverable derivatives contract market and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently plan their hedging activities, the RBI said.

Such transactions would be cash-settled in rupees and shall have the flexibility of cash settlement between two relevant banks and between a bank and a person residing outside India in rupees or any foreign currency.",The economic times
8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Also read: ICICI Bank branch manager duped depositors of crores for years to meet targets.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times
Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru."" The biggest challenge, he pointed out, for such projects specially in metros like Delhi, is land acquisition, said Bhagat.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

Indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge inducted into Indian Army,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:56:00 PM IST","A 46-metre indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge was inducted into the Indian Army on Tuesday, a move that will bolster the crucial bridging capability of the force's engineers. The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:58:00 PM IST","Meghana Malkan, Malkansview.com, says “there are two sectors that I would go by. One is the realty sector, the other is the pharma sector. Some kind of trade is being set in these two sectors. For example, when it comes to pharma, Zydus Lifescience is something I would be looking at. I will also be looking at Sun Pharma. Lupinis the third one.”.

Let us talk about the market. It is pretty quiet, isn't it? We have been consolidating for a while now. We have seen these sharper moves towards the day and otherwise. But what is your view? What are you making of the moves coming in the markets? Will we see a prolonged phase of consolidation after hitting new highs?
Meghana Malkan: Yes, we have been consolidating, but we are consolidating with the weakness at base. For example, if you talk about Nifty, I see very strong resistance coming at 22,200 and there are divergences on momentum indicators that makes Nifty on the weaker side. But where I see more weakness is in Bank Nifty. Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty and I believe it has a potential to go all the way down to 45,700. So, this is how I read both the indices.

But what do you make of the broader markets because they have been enjoying the party, they have been enjoying the ride and they have been outperforming the benchmark indices on most of the occasions. What is the trend that you are making out of the moves when it comes to the broader markets in particular?
Meghana Malkan: In particular, I believe there are these two sectors that I would go by. One is the realty sector, the other is the pharma sector. So, there is some kind of movement, some kind of trade that is being set in these two sectors. For example, when it comes to pharma, Zydus Lifescience is something I would be looking at. I will also be looking at Sun Pharma. So, these are the two stocks I will be looking at. Also, there is Lupin. It is a good short- to medium-term trade. If I enter right now, I can do that with a stop of say around Rs 775, which has the potential to go all the way up to Rs 840.

You also highlighted the realty sector and won’t not look at the PSU sector or do you think that everybody is giving it a break after the spectacular rally that the sector has seen?
Meghana Malkan: I would myself be taking it a break because considering the volume that is building up on the technical chart patterns and the way the momentum indicators are behaving, it calls for a break as of now. I will be focusing on these two sectors rather.

What do you make of the IT sector? Today, UBS has come out with a note, only on TCS, where they have upgraded the counter. They have hiked the targets. They are saying that maybe things are looking better for TCS, given the fact that they have bagged some big deals. But the IT sector can’t be painted with the same brush. What is your take?
Meghana Malkan: It is a kind of mixed bag. Some of them are weak. Some of them are showing quite an amount of strength in their technicals. If I see it from a higher time frame, I do not see a good chart pattern forming on any of them as of now. What I would do with this sector is really adopt a wait-and-watch approach. There are a few stocks that I am tracking at a few levels. Once these cross the resolution point, that could give me a better confirmation to go long on them.

ICICI Bank customer accuses manager of stealing Rs 16 crore from her FDs. Bank responds,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 06:29:00 PM IST","A Gurgaon woman has accused an ICICI Bank manager of embezzling Rs 16 crore from her account. This was reported by BBC. Shveta Sharma alleged that she transferred funds from her US account to ICICI Bank for fixed deposits, but the bank official created fake accounts, forged signatures, and obtained debit cards and cheque books in her name to withdraw money. The bank spokesperson acknowledged the fraud, emphasizing ICICI's reputation and commitment to punishment for those involved.

Sharma and her husband, who returned to India from the US and Hong Kong, deposited their life savings of around Rs 13.5 crore into the bank over four years from 2019 to 2023, according to the report, which would have now grown to Rs 16 crore. They opened a Non-Resident External (NRE) account on advice from a banker to take advantage of higher interest rates in India. Despite receiving receipts and regular statements, Sharma was shocked to discover in January that her fixed deposits had vanished.

""He gave me fake statements, created a fake email ID in my name and manipulated my mobile number in the bank records so I won't get any withdrawal notifications,"" she told the BBC.

Despite assurances from the bank, Sharma is still awaiting resolution. She has shared details with bank officials, spent days identifying fraudulent transactions, and lodged complaints with regulatory authorities and the police. The bank offered to deposit Rs 9.2 crore into her account pending investigation, but Sharma rejected it, stating it's insufficient and would freeze her account until the case is closed.

What ICICI Bank says
“We have communicated to the customer that we are ready to transfer the disputed amount of Rs 9.27 crore (she has already encashed a fixed deposit of Rs 2 crore) to her account with a lien, pending the outcome of the investigation,"" an ICICI Bank spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also pointed out that the bank ""has consistently sent transaction details to her registered mobile number and email id since the accounts were opened a few years ago. It is bewildering that the customer claims to be unaware of these transactions and balances in her account over the past three years, and she only recently noticed a discrepancy in her account balance. This discrepancy ought to have been observed by the customer when filing Income tax returns as well,"" the spokesperson said.

""She alleges that the mobile number and email ID of her account were changed without her knowledge. However, our records indicate that notifications regarding both changes were sent to her original mobile number and email address which were registered with the Bank. Furthermore, the new number is listed on the website of a company owned by the customer herself.""

ICICI Bank has lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EoW) of Delhi Police for a thorough investigation into the matter.

Another case involving ICICI Bank branch manager
ICICI Bank has made headlines for the wrong reasons twice this month alone. An ICICI Bank branch manager and his associates in Rajasthan successfully met business targets by withdrawing funds from unsuspecting account holders, creating a false impression of opening new FDs, current, and savings accounts. However, someone discovered the scheme and began blackmailing them, prompting further embezzlement from customers to pay off the blackmailer. Rajasthan Police confirmed about Rs 2.5 crore has been paid as hush money.

The branch manager and aides manipulated funds to meet performance targets, creating overdrafts against FDs to open new accounts, then closing them to return funds, a technique known as 'Entry and Reverse Entry'. The ICICI Bank spokesperson emphasized their commitment to investigating and ensuring no financial loss to genuine customers. Police formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the fraud, which involved freezing bank accounts and seizing cash and property. The scam was uncovered when an employee noticed missing funds in a friend's account, leading to police involvement and the exposure of the scheme. ICICI Bank promptly informed authorities of the scam after discovering irregularities.

NCLT approves Hinduja Group’s revival plan for Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:52:00 AM IST","The bankruptcy court in Mumbai allowed an application on Tuesday filed by the administrator of Reliance Capital to approve the Anil Ambani-promoted company’s acquisition by IndusInd International Holdings Ltd through the insolvency resolution process.

The division bench of Justice Virendra Singh Bisht and a technical member Prabhat Kumar approved the plan in an oral order. The detailed order is awaited.

Last year on June 29, the e-voting on resolution for approval of the resolution plan concluded, Reliance Capital’s Administrator Nageswara Rao Y said in a stock exchange announcement. However, he didn't disclose the financial details in the stock exchange announcement.

“This is one of the few big financial institutions which is getting resolved after DHFL and SREI under the code. On approval of the resolution plan, the claims of all the creditors and stakeholders shall be repaid in accordance with the approved resolution plan,” said Ashish Pyasi, Partner, Aendri Legal. “For the purpose of monitoring the plan implementation, a monitoring committee will be formed as per the plan so that there is no vacuum between the period of approval and the complete satisfaction of the terms of the plan.”

The order comes in the backdrop of the development wherein the veteran lawyer Shardul Shroff had approached the Supreme Court on behalf of Torrent Investments in October last year to speed up the hearing on the company's application to stay the second challenge mechanism in a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for the Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital.

At the heart of the dispute is a bid from the entity given 24 hours after the auction deadline (December 21, 2022), trumping the offer made within the stipulated time by Torrent Investments. Lenders decided to hold a second round of auction and that matter is pending before the Supreme Court.

While Torrent was the highest bidder offering Rs 8,640 crore in the first round, Hinduja offered Rs 9,660 crore in the second round. Torrent Investments, also in the fray for the distressed finance company, refrained from submitting a final plan to the lenders concerned.

In June, 99% of the lenders voted in favour of IIHL's plan. The administrator has admitted Rs 25,345 crore of claims from lenders as of June 8, 2023.

Now, Torrent Investments has challenged the view taken by NCLAT about Regulation 39 (1A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) that it does not restrict the rights of lenders to continue negotiation on financials and the decision to do a Second Challenge Mechanism even after its conclusion is not violative of Regulation 39(1A) of the CIRP Regulations.

As per Regulation 39(1A), the bidder must prepare a resolution plan in accordance with the bankruptcy code and submit the resolution plan to the RP within the time given in the invitation made by the RP or administrator in the current case.

In November 2019, the tribunal allowed an application to initiate an insolvency process against the debt-laden financier.",The economic times
"SC upholds demolition of Koyambedu mosque in Chennai, says unauthorised religious structures on public land must be removed","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:33:00 PM IST","In an important ruling, the Supreme Court of India has reiterated its stance on the removal of unauthorised religious structures constructed on public land, emphasizing the imperative for swift action by authorities nationwide. Upholding the demolition of Chennai's famous mosque in Koyambedu, SC says that unauthorised religious structures on public land can never be a venue for preaching religion. ""Move the mosque somewhere else, illegal encroachment in the name of religion will not be permitted, SC added.

The apex court, presided over by justices Surya Kant and KV Viswanathan, underscored the obligation of states and high courts to ensure the eradication of such encroachments, regardless of whether they are temples, churches, mosques, or gurdwaras.

The directive came in response to an appeal concerning a mosque unlawfully erected on public land in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The Madras High Court had previously ordered the removal of the mosque, a decision contested by the Hidaya Muslim Welfare Trust, represented by senior advocate S Nagamuthu.

Nagamuthu argued that the mosque posed no obstruction to the public and asserted that the trust had legally acquired the land. However, the court pointed out that the land was under the jurisdiction of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and that the construction had been undertaken without proper authorization.

Despite receiving a stop work notice from local authorities in 2020, the trust proceeded with the construction, prompting the Supreme Court to question the legitimacy of their actions.

""We are very clear...whether it’s a temple or a mosque, there cannot be unauthorised constructions,"" remarked the bench.

Ultimately, the court upheld the decision of the Madras High Court, affirming that the petitioner had no legal claim to the land and had proceeded with the construction unlawfully.

This ruling is in line with previous directives issued by the Supreme Court between 2009 and 2018, aimed at preventing the proliferation of unauthorised religious structures on public land. States and Union territories have been instructed to assess existing constructions on a case-by-case basis and take appropriate measures.

Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

All 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.
There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.
Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

'Congress government may topple in Himachal'
Earlier in the day, Himachal Pradesh Leader of Opposition and BJP leader Jairam Thakur had claimed that the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government is in a minority in the state.
When asked if the state BJP would demand a floor test, Thakur said, ""The budget will be presented on Wednesday. We will discuss the budget and then we will see the situation. But I can see that the government has lost the majority.""

"Narendra Modi flays DMK and Congress, praises MGR and Jayalalithaa","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:36 IST","PALLADAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at DMK and Congress on Tuesday but heaped praises on AIADMK icons MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa signalling that BJP was keeping the option of allying with AIADMK open.
Speaking at the valedictory meeting of BJP state president K Annamalai’s ‘En Mann En Makkal’ padayatra at Madappur near Palladam in Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur district, Modi said MGR was lauded as an incomparable leader by the people of TN because he had given good education and public health.

“He came to power through good deeds, not through dynasty. But the DMK is insulting him today,’’ Modi said, noting that he visited MGR’s place of birth in Sri Lanka during his recent trip to the island nation.
“After MGR, it was `Amma’ Jayalalithaa who gave good governance in Tamil Nadu,’’ the PM said. “She dedicated her entire life for the people of TN. I pay her my tributes. It was because of her service that she lives in the heart of Tamil Nadu people even today,’’ Modi said.
Modi’s speech comes in the backdrop of a shadow boxing between Tamil Nadu BJP and its erstwhile ally AIADMK attempting to poach leaders from each other.
Ever since AIADMK walked out of NDA in September last year, the BJP could not lure any major political parties into its fold in Tamil Nadu, except Tamil Maanila Congress, a light weight in the state. AIADMK has clarified that it will not patch up with BJP again. BJP for its part has begun stitching its own alliance in the state.

Modi’s remarks indicate that the saffron party keeps its option open for an AIADMK alliance.
Hitting out at DMK and Congress, Modi said the fate of INDIA front was sealed in Delhi. But the opposition front was trying to stay alive in TN to “to loot people in TN,” he said.
“It is time to lock their shop which has been opened to loot people,” he said. The right lock meant to shut the DMK – Congress shop has been created using the `En Mann En Makkal’ yatra, he said.
Listing out the welfare programmes -- including two defence corridors -- the BJP-led central government has implemented in TN, he asked if the Congress would implement such development schemes if it came to power. “Will those who received bribes to procure weapons allow development of defence corridors here?’’ he asked.
Modi said BJP had always prioritised growth of TN. “We have given more to TN in the last ten years than what the DMK-Congress alliance had given between 2004 and 2014,” he said. Hence, BJP has captured the hearts of people in TN, though the party was never in power in the state.
That was the reason, those who were looting TN for years are spreading lies, creating confusion and dividing people to hold on to power. “Their drama, however, has been exposed. Their corruption is being brought to light everyday,” he said in an apparent reference to corruption cases against DMK ministers.
Modi said BJP has emerged as a force to reckon with in TN and the party would create history in 2024.
BJP’s allies G K Vasan, A C Shanmugam and Devanathan Yadav were present on the stage along with BJP leaders L Murugan and K Annamalai in the public meeting touted as a biggest show of strength by BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
Modi who landed at Sulur Air Force base in Coimbatore took a chopper to reach the meeting venue. From the helipad he came to the stage, designed like a lotus, on an open jeep waving to the crowd amidst slogans `Vendum Modi, Meendum Modi.’
The yatra inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah in Rameswaram in June last year covered all the assembly constituencies.

"Smriti Mandhana blitz, disciplined bowlers power RCB to 8-wicket win over Gujarat Giants in WPL","Feb 27, 2024, 22:44 IST","NEW DELHI: Skipper Smriti Mandhana's explosive innings and a disciplined bowling performance led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a convincing eight-wicket victory over the struggling Gujarat Giants in their Women's Premier League (WPL) clash in Bengaluru on Tuesday.
Chasing a target of 108 runs, RCB's Mandhana (43, 27 balls, 8x4, 1x6) and S Meghana (36, 28 balls, 5x4, 1x6) formed a solid partnership of 40 runs for the second wicket, effortlessly achieving the target in just 12.3 overs.
This win marked RCB's second consecutive victory in the WPL.

RCB's success was built upon the excellent foundation laid by their bowlers, with pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) and left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux (3/25) being the standout performers after the team opted to bowl. The Giants struggled to post a competitive total, managing only 107 for 7.

Mandhana set the tone for RCB's chase with a powerful start, smashing two fours in the first two balls off pacer Lea Tahuhu. The left-hander's aggressive innings included a well-timed pull and a six over the head of Tahuhu, contributing to RCB amassing 13 runs in the opening over.

Despite losing Sophine Devine in the fourth over, Mandhana continued her onslaught. Although she missed out on a fifty, her entertaining innings highlighted the contrast with the Giants' earlier struggles on the same pitch.

The Giants' captain Beth Mooney (8) fell victim to Renuka's strategic change in line, while Phoebe Litchfield was stumped by Richa Ghosh. Renuka, bowling her full quota of four overs, concluded with impressive figures of 4-0-14-2.

The Giants faced continuous setbacks, losing key wickets, including that of Ashleigh Gardner, hindering their efforts to boost the innings. Dayalan Hemalatha's unbeaten 31 off 25 balls helped the Giants reach just beyond the 100-run mark.
RCB bowlers maintained control throughout the innings, limiting the Giants to only 10 fours and two sixes, underscoring the difficulty the Giants encountered on the field.

"State units agree with Rohit Sharma's 'hunger' comment, say BCCI Ranji diktat is potential saviour","Feb 27, 2024, 17:57 IST","NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma emphasised the importance of Test opportunities being reserved for players displaying a genuine hunger for the format. This sentiment resonated with state associations grappling with young talents eager to make a mark in white-ball cricket but hesitant to invest in the grind of first-class games.
The ongoing debate between club and country has been fueled by the emergence of the IPL, and Rohit's firm stance on the matter coincided with established players like Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan ignoring a BCCI directive to participate in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, choosing instead to concentrate on their IPL preparations.


""Jin logon ko bhookh hai, hum unhi logon ko mauka denge (We will give opportunities to only those who are hungry),"" Rohit declared on Monday after a series-clinching win over England in the fourth Test in Ranchi.

""Agar hunger nahi hai to unko khila ke koi matlab nahi hai (There's no point in playing those who don't have the hunger),"" he said.
The hunger that Rohit emphasised was evident in emerging talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep, and the more established Shubman Gill, all of whom showcased their skills at different points in the series against England.
However, Rohit underscored the issue regarding unnamed individuals who appear to lack that passionate drive and determination.

""I concur with the Indian captain. There should be hunger in younger cricketers to play the longest format,"" Abhilash Khandekar, president of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association, told PTI.
It is for those that the BCCI issued a directive earlier this month asking centrally-contracted cricketers to be available for Ranji engagements.
Several representatives from state associations admitted that Rohit was not off the mark when he said those who are not up for it should not be considered for the toughest format. But they also feel that a system needs to be in place so that such a situation never arises.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

""Ranji Trophy cannot be taken lightly by any player, it is the backbone of Indian cricket. It is the most important tournament in domestic cricket. This should be followed up in other formats in domestic cricket,"" Khandekar said.
Another official, who did not wish to be named, went to the extent of saying that Ranji Trophy ran the risk of ""a slow death if it was not made mandatory for top players to compete.""
State units see the parent body's move as a case of better late than never.
""I complement BCCI for this decision of compelling players to play for their state in Ranji Trophy. I see it as a case of better late than never, this is going to help domestic cricket in a big way,"" said Khandekar.
In the recent past, the Indian batters have been found vulnerable on turning tracks at home.
Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar believes if elite players turn up for their respective states in Ranji Trophy whenever available, it would only make them better players of spin.
""Playing Ranji is very important. It helps you play spin better on Indian wickets, your overall skills are improved. And when you play foreign teams, it becomes easier (to face spin),"" said Vengsarkar, himself a great player of spin.
""I feel it is a player's wish whether to play Ranji or not. If he doesn't want to play, we have enough in India to choose from, they will play and establish themselves. No one is bigger than the game. No one is indispensable,"" he said.
In Kishan's absence from the ongoing series, Dhruv Jurel made the most of the opportunity by coming up with two brilliant under-pressure knocks in only his second Test.
Like the MPCA chief, a state unit official proposed another step to rein in players who ignore red-ball cricket.
""This was a much needed step and should have been taken earlier. If an India player is regularly featuring in Ranji Trophy, it acts a massive motivator to the younger players in the squad.
""I would also want the BCCI to empower state units to ban those players who don't play Ranji Trophy. If a senior is dropped for once, the juniors would not dare to ignore their red ball commitments for T20 cricket,"" said a state unit official requesting anonymity.

"Rajya Sabha polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP one in Karnataka","Feb 27, 2024, 19:12 IST","NEW DELHI: In a major win for the ruling Congress, all three of its Rajya Sabha candidates secured the requisite number of votes to win their respective seats from Karnataka, after one BJP MLA cross-voted for the ruling party and another abstained.
Karnataka deputy chief minister D.K. Shivakumar said: ""This shows the unity and integrity of Congress. I thank all the MLAs, party workers and the media.
I'm very happy to inform you that all Congress candidates have won. I thank all voters, CM and party workers and the AICC President also. I would like to thank Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge.""
Congress candidates Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken won with 47 votes, while G C Chandrashekhar secured 45 votes.
The BJP won 1 Rajya Sabha seat from the state with candidate Narayansa Bhandage securing 47 votes. The BJP-JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy lost the polls.

Each Rajya Sabha candidate needed at least 45 votes in the 224-MLA Karnataka Assembly to win a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. With 135 MLAs, the Congress had the exact number to elect its three candidates.
The BJP has 66 MLAs, which secured a comfortable win for party worker Narayansa Bhandage.
The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members -- Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar (BJP) and Congress's G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah.

Two BJP MLAs cross-vote
In a setback to the BJP-JD(S) alliance, saffron party MLA S T Somashekar voted for Maken while MLA Arbail Shivaram Hebbar abstained from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections for the four seats in Karnataka on Tuesday.
Somashekar represents Yashwantpur assembly constituency and Hebbar the Yellapur segment.
Leader of Opposition R Ashoka said they would seek action against Somashekhar, and termed the MLA's decision ""political suicide"".
Soon after voting, Somashekar told reporters that he voted as per his conscience. ""I went by my conscience and voted for those who worked for building schools and carry out development works in my constituency,"" the rebel BJP leader said.
Ashoka said Hebbar had been in touch with him since morning and assured him that he would vote for the BJP candidate.
""Hebbar had been telling me that he would not betray the party, but I don't know why he did not turn up to vote. He double-crossed us today, which he should not have done. We will initiate action against him,"" Ashoka said.
Both the MLAs had defected from Congress to the BJP along with 15 others, bringing down the 14-month-old coalition government of the Congress and the JD(S) in 2019 facilitating the installation of the BJP government.
In 2023, they once again got elected to the assembly on the BJP ticket.

"Forget your chargers: This 28,000mAh power bank doubles up as an Android phone","Feb 27, 2024, 12:32 IST","Energizer has revealed its newest phone, the Hard Case P28K, boasting an incredibly large 28,000mAh battery alongside a rugged, durable design. Unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona this week, the phone promises exceptional battery life for off-the-grid use while travelling or in areas with unreliable power.
With its massive internal battery, Energizer claims the P28K can last up to a whole week on a single charge with typical usage.
Talk time reaches an astounding 122 hours continuously, while standby time is pegged at a staggering 94 days by the company. Despite the size, Avenir Telecom, maker of Energizer phones, states the battery can still be replenished from 0% to 100% in around 1.5 hours.
However, such an enormous battery comes with its own drawbacks. Weighing in at 570 grams, the phone is weighty compared to conventional smartphones. At nearly 28mm thick, it is also more than triple the thickness of standard phones on shelves currently. However, the phone is at least durable, or that's what Energizer markets it as, thanks to an IP69 rating for dust and water protection.
Beyond a power bank - A look at the phone’s specs
Inside, the Hard Case P28K is equipped like a basic smartphone, with entry-level specs that include a MediaTek Helio G99 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, and a 6.78” 1080p LCD. It ships running Android 14 software. Cameras are led by a 64MP main sensor and accompanied by a 20MP ultrawide and 16MP selfie camera.

Priced at €250 in Europe, the phone won’t officially launch until October. Unfortunately for customers in other regions, Avenir Telecom says it has no plans to sell the phone outside of Europe for now.
Energizer has also made headlines with past concepts for phones with similarly giant batteries, though those devices ultimately never materialised as real products brought to market. Four years ago, at the MWC, Avenir showcased another concept – another Android phone with an 18,000mAh battery. Then, two years before that, the company showed off another phone that had a 16,000mAh battery.

India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.

A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India
Biden tries to turn tables on Trump: 'About as old as I am',"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:00 IST","President Joe Biden has come up with a new defence against claims that he is too old to run for another term: At least he knows who his wife is - as opposed to ""the other guy"". As he expands his efforts to reassure voters that he is fit for another four years, Biden took a turn on the talk show circuit, using an appearance on ""Late Night With Seth Meyers"" on NBC to poke his challenger, former President Donald Trump, on his own struggles with memory.

In a playful but pointed interview aired early Tuesday, Meyers sought to help the president address the age issue, which polls show is an important drawback in the minds of most voters. Meyers jokingly told the president that he had obtained classified information indicating that ""you are currently 81 years old"".
Biden went along with the joke. ""Who the hell told you that?"" he asked. ""That's classified!"" He then went on to jab Trump, who is 77, over a video in which he seems to call his wife, Melania, by another name. ""You got to take the other guy,"" Biden said. ""He's about as old as I am, but he can't remember his wife's name."" Turning serious, he added the contest is not about how old the candidates are. ""It's about how old your ideas are,"" he said. ""Look, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back on Roe v. Wade.""
The president has been on the defensive about his memory in recent weeks, particularly since a special counsel, in a report on Biden's handling of classified documents, explained that one reason he would not charge Biden is because he would come across to a jury as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"". During his interview with the special counsel, the report said, Biden could not remember key dates of his vice presidency or the year his son Beau died. Biden's defenders assailed the special counsel for mentioning that.

Trump has had plenty of moments of confusion in recent weeks as well. Among other things, he has mixed up his Republican opponent Nikki Haley with former speaker Nancy Pelosi, claimed to have beaten Barack Obama in 2016 rather than Hillary Clinton and warned that the country is on the verge of WWII. The moment Biden was referring to came during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland over the weekend when Trump was praising his wife and then, as the audience applauded, said, ""Oh, look at that, Mercedes - that's pretty good."" But Trump was addressing Mercedes Schlapp, a former White House adviser whose husband, Matt Schlapp, the chair of the American Conservative Union, hosts the conference, the ex-president's spokesperson said. Still, Trump has in the past misspelled Melania's name on Twitter as ""Melanie"".

Biden joined Meyers to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the late-night show, a decade after appearing on the program's debut episode in 2014 when he was vice-president. The audience was an important one for Biden, who relied on strong support among younger voters to defeat Trump in 2020.
When Meyers noted that many on the political right have embraced a bizarre conspiracy theory that he and Taylor Swift ""are working in cahoots,"" Biden playfully snapped: ""Where are you getting this information? It's classified. That's classified information."" ""But,"" he quickly added, ""I will tell you she endorsed me in 2020.""

The role of body image and self-esteem in the development and recovery from eating disorders,"Feb 27, 2024, 19:23 IST","Eating disorders affect an estimated 2-3% of the population worldwide, predominantly women. In fact, conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder are not just medical terms; they are also lived experiences deeply intertwined with how individuals perceive their bodies and value themselves.
In the last few years, the term ""body image"" has woven itself into the fabric of our daily conversations, yet its profound impact on eating disorders remains underexplored.
But, can negative body image trigger these conditions? Are issues of self-worth at the core of every eating disorder?
The answers are multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of this issue. Today, we'll explore how societal acceptance, or the lack thereof, shapes our body image and self-esteem, setting the stage for a discussion on the pivotal role these factors play in both the onset and recovery from eating disorders.
We unravel the layers of this critical topic, aiming to foster understanding and compassion towards those affected.

Self-esteem reflects our own valuation of ourselves. Possessing high self-esteem typically means we feel positively about our inner and outer selves. Low self-esteem can make us doubt ourselves and look for ways to improve how we feel, sometimes focusing too much on our appearance.
Body Image is how we see our physical selves and what we think about that. If we like what we see in the mirror, we have a positive body image. If we don't like what we see, our body image is negative. This doesn't just influence how we dress or carry ourselves; it deeply affects our inner world.

Eating Behavior is how we eat, which includes what, when, and why we eat. This can range from healthy, regular meals to unhealthy patterns like eating too much, too little, or in a way that doesn't give our body what it needs.
How They Connect:

Imagine your mind is a seesaw. On one side, you have self-esteem, and on the other, you have body image. When both sides are balanced, the seesaw stays level — this balance leads to healthy eating behaviors. However, if one side is too heavy (like if we have really low self-esteem or a very negative body image), the seesaw tips. This imbalance can lead us to develop unhealthy eating behaviors as a way to try to ""fix"" whatever we think is wrong.
The Science, Made Simple:

The Beginning: It may start innocently: someone feeling they're a bit overweight and decide it's time for a change. With an initial goal to lose weight, they begin to restrict their eating. This stage is crucial because it's where the seeds of an eating disorder can be sown, although the individual's intentions are to improve their health and appearance.
The Mind's Role: As the weight starts to come off, there's a noticeable boost in body image. Compliments flow in, reinforcing the behavior. This is where the mind plays a pivotal role. The positive feedback loop - weight loss leading to compliments, leading to further restriction - can alter perception. The original weight loss goal shifts; what was once enough no longer satisfies. Deviation from restrictive dietary behavior may then fuel the feeling of guilt, which may also lead them to self-induced purging. This dissatisfaction fuels a distorted self-image.

The mind becomes preoccupied with controlling food intake, where eating something considered ""bad"" or missing an exercise session triggers anxiety or fear. This is a hallmark of how low self-esteem and poor body image begin to warp the individual's relationship with food and their body.
The Body's Response: Physically, the body responds to these changes in diet and exercise in several ways. Initially, weight loss might improve certain health markers, but as restriction continues, the body enters a state of stress. Nutrient deficiencies can develop due to restrictions or purging, metabolism may slow down, and physical health can deteriorate. The body, in an effort to conserve energy, can reduce the resources allocated to non-essential functions, affecting everything from hormonal balance to bone density.
The Cycle of Eating Disorders: The cycle that ensues is driven by a complex interaction between mental and physical health. The brain, fixated on controlling food and weight, can push the body further into malnutrition. This obsession with food and fear of gaining weight can lead to conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.
The Mental Struggle: Psychologically, the person becomes trapped in a cycle of negative self-talk, where their self-worth is intrinsically linked to their body image and ability to control their eating. This cycle is self-perpetuating; the more the individual strives to control their diet to improve their self-esteem and body image, the more entrenched the eating disorder becomes. Anxiety, depression, and isolation can follow, making recovery more challenging.

Breaking the Cycle

Recovery involves addressing both the mental and physical aspects of the disorder. It's about relearning healthy eating habits, yes, but also about rebuilding self-esteem and developing a positive body image that isn't tied to weight or food. Psychotherapy, nutritional counseling, and support groups are often key components of a successful recovery strategy.
Psychotherapy: Some therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or Existential therapy, are central to treating eating disorders. It helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors related to their eating habits, body image, and self-esteem.
Through therapy, patients learn coping strategies to manage distressing emotions and thoughts without resorting to unhealthy eating behaviors.
Nutritional Counseling: Nutritional counseling is provided by dietitians specialized in eating disorders. It aims to restore healthy eating patterns and address misconceptions about food and diet. Nutritional counseling educates individuals on the importance of balanced nutrition and helps them develop a peaceful relationship with food.
It involves creating personalized meal plans that ensure the body receives the nutrients it needs for recovery, while also respecting the patient's likes and dislikes, gradually reintroducing feared foods, and teaching portion control.
Embracing self-compassion, limiting social media, engaging in physical activity, surrounding yourself with positivity, and challenging negative thoughts are crucial steps towards improving self-esteem and body image.
These strategies not only foster a healthier relationship with food but also pave the way for a fulfilling, balanced life. Remember, the journey to self-love and acceptance is ongoing, filled with small yet significant victories.

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.

Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam. The aspirants from rural areas are not likely to face difficulty as all facilities are available in every nook and corner,” says Pathak.
The Commission said that the name of the candidate and the date on which the photograph was taken must also be mentioned clearly on the photograph. The faces of the candidates should also occupy three-fourths of the space in the photograph, the official notification said.
The Commission has also asked the candidates to make sure that their appearance matches their photograph at each stage of the examination process – Preliminary, Mains (written) and Interview or Personality test. For instance, if a candidate uploads a bearded photograph, he must appear with the same look in the Preliminary, Mains (Written) and Interview/Personality Test. Same would be the case with spectacles, moustaches, etc.
Candidates who wish to apply for the Civil Service Examination=Preliminary 2024 for about 1,056 vacant posts, can visit the official website at upsc.gov.in and submit the application form. Candidates scoring above the cut-off marks in CSE prelims will become eligible to register for the main examination. The mains will be descriptive and will be conducted from September 20 for five days.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.

"Focus is on offering solutions against selling the products: Dinesh K Khara, Chairman, State Bank of India","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:44:00 AM IST","Much-needed private investments to quicken the pace of economic expansion are just ‘around the corner’, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara tells Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan, pointing to aggregate capacity utilisation reaching thresholds that have historically prompted corporate boards to draw up expansion plans.

Mumbai-based SBI, which reported record profits topping Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal year, is the winner of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in the Company of the Year category. In an interview touching upon a wide range of topics, Khara tells ET that India’s focus on building manufacturing muscle would further strengthen the growth capex trend and, in turn, banks that are expected to help finance India's spectacular and exciting journey along the competitiveness gradient. Edited excerpts:


There are a couple of reasons — a part of it comes from the macro and some part of it from the contribution from all the SBIians. It's more like a citizenship of the bank. Since the macro was doing well in terms of the demand which was demonstrated during Covid and also the enabling ecosystem created by the government, it created a very positive environment for the bank. Covid was the first test of resilience of the banking system and of the State Bank of India. The other piece was the positivity in the organisation that helped us in getting the best out of everyone at SBI. And when they started tasting success, their confidence improved. Ensuring the timely delivery and keeping a very close eye in terms of the quality of the loan book helped us in generating interest income where we were not required to make any provisions.


During Covid there were not enough opportunities for lending. But at the same time there are enough deposits. We went for the rupee dollar swaps and we supported our international balance sheet. We got into supply chain financing activity in our overseas operation. When we could see the demand coming up in India, we unwound those rupee dollar swaps and brought the money back and supported the growth in the domestic economy.


During Covid there was a reasonable demand we saw for retail growth. We looked at opportunities and worked out what all solutions we can offer. So orientation was changed in terms of offering solutions as against selling the products. We were quite cognizant of the fact that recovery of the economy will depend upon the growth of the SMEs. So, we started investing in terms of the infrastructure for SME, and ensured that each of the zonal offices of the bank, which are more than 100 across the country, had a AGM level officer who was responsible for SME loans and brought the sanctioning committees nearer to the ground. We had taken up the task to scale up this SME business to around `4 lakh crore and I am happy to share that today we have already crossed the `4 lakh crore and much before the financial year 2023-24 target we had set. Our SME book has got perhaps one of the lowest gross NPA which is at 4.33%.


We looked at the opportunities available and ensured that we have adequate infrastructure in place to ensure that we underwrite a quality book and we should have effective follow up... We came out with the loan management system. Now we have brought in the business division in SME. We came out with the pre-approved business loans. So we did a lot of work in this space and that is the reason why we can now see a Rs 4 lakh crore book which is very strong in terms of quality.


Our agri book was also stagnating for many years at about Rs 2 lakh crore. At that point of time we said that we should take it to Rs 3 lakh crore and today we are almost at that number — Rs 2.92 lakh crore.

In terms of quality also, even in this book we used to have high gross NPA, now it has been brought into the single digit. In the SME space, we also took help from our large corporate relationships. We started mapping their vendor distributor ecosystem end to end so that they will have a very dependable supply chain and also at the same time we would have the visibility of the cash flows for these enterprises.


There are a couple of things which have taken place in the ecosystem and this is essentially coming from the credit bureaus, particularly in the retail segment. Credit bureaus have changed the trajectory because there is enough and the clear visibility in terms of the credit history of the borrower. In retail, one should have the system structure in place unless and until the structure is well oiled, there can be challenges in retail. So that is the reason why we invested well in the structure. All our retail loans we have got the loan management system which are end to end digital and also it leaves hardly any discussion on ground and they are all having the business rule in general embedded into it. So when the scale goes up, there has to be uniformity in the underwriting standards. That is the reason why in our retail book, the gross NPA is actually less than 0.70%.


When it comes to private capex, there are different stages. Normally, it comes to the drawing board when the capacity utilization reaches somewhere around 75%. If we look at some of the numbers in 2022-23, we have seen the capital commitment to the tune of Rs 37 lakh crore by the private corporates. Also in the first half it is around Rs 20 lakh crore. When it comes to the growth in numbers there is always a lag between corporate credit and capital commitment. Once people have got a clear visibility of the demand, they start evaluating the options relating to the capex. The undisbursed limits for the term loans have been released. So that's a very clear reflection that there is a definite departure as compared to the past. That gives us the confidence that the private capex is just around the corner.


All the initiatives which have been taken by the government in terms of the infrastructure creation has also created an enabling environment because eventually the road and rail infrastructure which is getting created will lead to a situation where the logistic cost is going to come down. They are aiming to bring it down by half to about 7% and I think they are much on course. There is a very clear focus of orienting this economy to become manufacturing oriented. That also is going to be one of the other factors leading to even more capex commitments also.


We are quite well placed at current levels at somewhere around 67-68%. The RBI is not prescribing any credit deposit ratio, but nevertheless, there has to be enough deposit base so that there is enough muscle in the banking system to lend. What I expect is banks will be even more careful, and choosy in terms of picking up the assets which they should support. So that is something that appears to be the potential outcome.


CASA before Covid used to be around 40% in the system, so, I would say that it is actually coming back to the same levels after going to around 44% during Covid because there were not enough opportunities for people to spend money. Now people are coming back to spending habits. That's one aspect. The second aspect is that invariably we have seen that during inflationary times, there is a tendency on the part of all savers to put their money in high interest earning assets class. It is a part of the cycle.


Banking system would be Rs 200 lakh crore, mutual fund industry would be about Rs 50 lakh crore, life insurance is about Rs 60 lakh crore. Pension fund is about Rs 10 lakh crore, and I think when it comes to the stock market, it would be about Rs 300 odd lakh crore. That is the broad composition. Even if youngsters are putting their money into SIP, they will route it through the banking system. That money in any case has to be channelised through the system only. There will be competition vis-a-vis the fixed deposit but it is the financial literacy which will perhaps eventually guide.


Competition is a reality which none of us can ignore and obviously when it comes to banking to strike a fine balance between the cost of deposit and the returns which they will generate. So the fact remains that if at all you want to maintain the excellent asset quality, you should be in a position to lend at the most competitive rates and for lending at the most competitive rates, you must be in a position to keep a check on your cost of resources. It is a very fine balance which people have to maintain because there are multiple stakeholders whose aspirations must be honored.


In the retail segment, growth was at a very high pace, at about 30% for many of the entities and that too in the very low ticket size. A little greater analysis revealed that much of it was being given based upon the spending patterns, whereas prudent lending principle suggests that it should be based upon the ability of people to repay, which means that their EMI to NMI (Net Monthly Income) ratio becomes very critical. That is the reason why perhaps RBI came down on the unsecured loans. Such entities were not having enough recovery mechanisms in place. RBI came down with such prescriptions to ensure that there should be orderly growth in the system and there should not be unhealthy growth.


Across the globe, the financial sector is very tightly regulated. The safety and security of the system is a function of the safety and security of all the players who are there in the ecosystem. FinTechs have a capability, they are very agile, they are in a position to offer solutions to a problem and to that extent, they actually create value for the system. As an entity, we are consuming the services of Fintech. But, yes of course, being a regulated entity, this is something which is on the top of our mind always, that anything which we do, it should be in line with what is the prescription from the regulator. Whereas as a part of DNA, they are more independent in terms of their thinking, in terms of offering solutions. It is for the mutual benefit for fintechs to understand and appreciate the ecosystem and the regulatory environment and for entities like banks to consume their services so that even banks become nimble. Fintechs can, you know, play second fiddle or substitute the bank's efforts rather than trying to be something on their own.


We have to stay ahead of the curve and for that we have to keep on investing in terms of understanding the evolving trends and how we should strengthen our risk management capabilities. Even in the good times, we are having a sharper focus on the risk management capability of the bank and we are investing well in terms of understanding the risk. We are having this sort of modelling for all kinds of risks. For the time being things look perfectly okay. We should have the mitigants in place. The fundamental principle is that the balance sheet should always remain strong",The economic times
CCI proposes changes to confidential info sharing,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 AM IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has proposed to amend the so-called ""confidentiality ring"" regime that governs the treatment of confidential information in its proceedings, seeking to streamline the processes and prevent any delays in disposal of cases.

The regime, introduced in 2022, allows parties involved in a case to have access to confidential information or documents relating to other parties in an investigation to better defend themselves, subject to riders.

The draft regulations released by the anti-trust regulator have set a time frame for seeking and granting access to confidential information.

The CCI has proposed that the party seeking access to confidential information must request for setting up a confidentiality ring at the earliest. If such a request is made by a party after the receipt of the non-confidential version of the investigation report, it will be made within seven days, with a provision to give another 7 days, subject to conditions. The regulator has sought stakeholder comments on the draft proposals until March 27.

Neelambera Sandeepan, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said the proposed amendments aim to ""prevent delays caused in enforcement proceedings on account of accessibility of confidential documents"". They also specify conditions and circumstances as to when the confidentiality rings can be set up, she said.

A party seeking confidentiality over the information or documents furnished by it will set out cogent reasons for such a treatment, the draft said. The party must specify the date on which such confidential treatment will expire on a self-certification basis, it said.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

""A merit-based immigration system that protects American labour and promotes American values"" is what Trump has pledged to pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he suspended numerous work visas and implemented measures to restrict access to certain visa programs during his first time in office.",The economic times
States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:57:00 AM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.


“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:


US markets

The Dow led Wall Street lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

At 09:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.05 points, or 0.26%, at 38,967.18, the S&P 500 was down 2.79 points, or 0.06%, at 5,066.74, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.59 points, or 0.05%, at 15,967.67.

European Markets

European shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in basic resources stocks and a string of upbeat earnings, while investors and central bankers braced for inflation data this week that could alter the course for interest rates.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ticked up 0.1% by 9:35 GMT, while Germany's benchmark DAX climbed 0.4%, logging another record high.

Investors are taking a pause after last week's surge in artificial intelligence-driven buying which propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high.

Tech View

In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.

Most active stocks in terms of turnover

CMS Infosystems (Rs 1,684 crore), ICICI Lombard General Insurance (Rs 1,179 crore), Vodafone Idea (Rs 187 crore), IREDA (Rs 174 crore) were among the most active stocks on BSE in value terms.

Ruling BJP kills two birds with one stone in Uttar Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:49:00 AM IST","Lucknow: BJP's strategy to bring SP MLAs to its side and garner the magic number for the victory of its eighth Rajya Sabha candidate also conceals a well-thought-out plan of strengthening itself in some weak Lok Sabha seats to which some MLAs belong, while giving a jolt to Samajwadi Party's morale ahead of the general elections.

At least seven SP MLAs are suspected to have cross-voted for BJP's candidates on Tuesday. The spadework for Tuesday likely began at least a fortnight ago, after which, assured of extra support, Sanjay Seth was brought in as the surprise eighth candidate by BJP. The party needed eight extra votes for Seth's win. Alarm bells first rang when eight SP MLAs skipped the dinner hosted by chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday and remained unreachable. On Tuesday morning, the first blow was dealt by SP MLA from Unchahar, Raebareli, Manoj Pandey, who resigned from the post of chief whip of the party before the voting commenced. Later, these MLAs were seen posing with deputy CM Brajesh Pathak confirming all doubts. Akhilesh Yadav declared that all who have cross-voted will be ousted from the party.

Observers say BJP has achieved two objectives. Not only will this deal a blow to SP, some MLAs, who have cross-voted and will likely be seen in BJP in the coming days, represent parts of Lok Sabha seats which BJP views as a challenge like Raebareli and Ambedkarnagar.

Apart from Raebareli Sadar assembly seat which is represented by BJP's Aditi Singh, all the remaining four assembly seats of the Raebareli LS constituency are occupied by SP, in what could have made it an uphill battle for BJP, coupled with the fact that it is a Congress bastion. Pandey's switchover, considering his credentials as a strong Brahmin face, will provide a significant boost to the party's prospects there and he may even be fielded as the BJP candidate from the seat, as is being speculated.

Top BJP leaders head to Bihar as Lok Sabha polls draw near,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:33:00 AM IST","New Delhi: Within a fortnight beginning Wednesday, BJP's top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, will address public meetings in Bihar as part of BJP-led NDA's aim to win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The coalition, which won 39 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming for a clean sweep bolstered by JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar's return.

On March 2, Modi will address two public meetings in Aurangabad and Begusarai. This will be his first visit to Bihar after Kumar switched sides and rejoined NDA. Modi and Kumar will share the stage in Aurangabad after a long time.

Singh will visit Bihar on Wednesday. He will visit Sitamarhi and Darbhanga to address meetings. On Thursday, Shah will review poll preparedness and address a meeting of party workers near Patna.

The opposition camp too is planning a show of strength with a joint rally in Patna on March 3 in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to participate. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been touring the state as part of his Jan Vishwas Yatra, which will conclude on February 29.

"Shami undergoes ankle surgery, set to miss IPL","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:31:00 AM IST","Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami has undergone a successful surgery on his left achilles tendon, which rules him out of next month's Indian Premier League and possibly the T20 World Cup in June. The 33-year-old, who last played for India in the ODI World Cup final against Australia on November 19, went under the knife in London on Monday.

Shami, who is eager to ""get back on my feet soon"" stares at a recovery time of a minimum of three months.

He will thus miss the IPL slated to be played from March 22 to May 26, as reported by PTI last week.

Shami is also a doubtful starter for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.

""Just had a successful heel operation on my achilles tendon! Recovery is going to take some time, but looking forward to getting back on my feet,"" Shami tweeted, along with several pictures of him in the hospital, on X on Monday.

— MdShami11 (@MdShami11)

Shami, who was one of the architects of India's stupendous ODI World Cup campaign with 24 wickets, had played through pain as he had problems with his landing but didn't let it affect his performance.

He had flown to London in January to take special ankle injections. However, the medication didn't work and the fast bowler had to opt for surgery.

The absence of Shami is a major blow for Gujarat Titans, who have also traded all-rounder Hardik Pandya to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash deal. Shami was the side's highest wicket-taker during their runner-up finish in IPL last year.

Shami, who was recently conferred with the Arjuna Award, has 229 Test, 195 ODI and 24 T20 wickets in his decade-long career.

The development raises a question mark about the injury rehabilitation management programme planned by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for Shami.

It is also highly unlikely that the pacer would be able to make a comeback before India's Test matches at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand (October November).

His target could be the marquee away series against Australia.

Army called in amid fresh tension in Manipur; Assam Rifles deployed after senior cop abducted briefly,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:25:00 AM IST","The Army was called in as fresh tension mounted in Manipur on Tuesday and four columns of the Assam Rifles were deployed in Imphal East after a senior police officer was abducted allegedly by cadres of the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation, from his residence, officials said. The officer, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumar, posted in the operations wing of the Manipur Police, was rescued after a swift action by police and security forces, the officials said.

The officer has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

Giving details of the incident that took place around 7 pm on Tuesday, the officials said that a group of cadres owing allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol attacked the house of Kumar at Wangkhei in Imphal East.

The reason for this indiscriminate firing was that the officer concerned had arrested six members of the group for their alleged involvement in vehicle theft, the officials said.

Following the arrests, a group of Meira Paibis (Meitei women group) had protested and blocked roads demanding their release.

In the Tuesday evening attack, armed cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol ransacked the house and damaged at least four vehicles with gunfire, they said.

Detailing the chaotic events, M Kulla, the police officer's father, explained, ""We tried to talk to the armed men after they entered, but all of a sudden they started firing at the vehicles and properties. So we had to rush inside and lock ourselves.""

The father, according to the officials, called his son and informed about the incident.

The officer rushed with his team only to be abducted as they were outnumbered by the cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol.

The Manipur Police acted promptly, mobilising forces to launch a successful rescue operation, ensuring Kumar's safe return within hours.

The state government had to take help of the Army as the situation worded after the rescue efforts.

Officials said that four columns of the Assam Rifles were requisitioned and deployed around the area where the incident took place. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is not applicable in valley areas.

The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, functions under the operational command of the Army.

The region has witnessed escalating violence since May 3, with over 180 casualties reported after a ""Tribal Solidarity March"" in the hill districts protested the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

The Meiteis, constituting around 53 per cent of Manipur's population and residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, contrast the tribals, including Nagas and Kukis, who make up 40 per cent and primarily inhabit the hill districts.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. runs McDonald's in western India and South India. operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.",The economic times
NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

BJP wins eight Rajya Sabha seats; SP bags two seats in UP,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:04:00 PM IST","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday won eight, out of ten, Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, SP bagged two seats in the state.

Voting in the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh began around 9 am on Tuesday. The BJP had fielded eight candidates and the Samajwadi Party (SP) three.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

Of the four others, the Congress claimed the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and was confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.

The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members - Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP and G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah from the Congress.

The Congress, which was confident of winning three seats had fielded G C Chandrashekhar, Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken.

The BJP had fielded Narayansa Bhandage as also JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy as the NDA candidate which had made the election interesting.

Congress sources claimed that the party has the support of four others, reported PTI.

""Besides, we may get three votes from the rival camp,"" a top Congress source told PTI.

Fearing cross-voting, the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance huddled their MLAs in a private resort on Monday.

They also conducted a workshop for the new members to inform them about the election process and how to cast their votes.

All parties have issued whips to the MLAs, who are the voters in Tuesday's poll, amid apprehensions of cross-voting.

According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, the preference votes kick in.

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan
What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

The step was taken in order to develop the onshore rupee non-deliverable derivatives contract market and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently plan their hedging activities, the RBI said.

Such transactions would be cash-settled in rupees and shall have the flexibility of cash settlement between two relevant banks and between a bank and a person residing outside India in rupees or any foreign currency.",The economic times
Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times

Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru.""

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

"Elon Musk raises his Microsoft 'customer care' complaint directly to Satya Nadella, here's what he said","Feb 27, 2024, 16:23 IST","Clearly the text didn’t seem to have worked. Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

All 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.
There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.
Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

'Congress government may topple in Himachal'
Earlier in the day, Himachal Pradesh Leader of Opposition and BJP leader Jairam Thakur had claimed that the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government is in a minority in the state.
When asked if the state BJP would demand a floor test, Thakur said, ""The budget will be presented on Wednesday. We will discuss the budget and then we will see the situation. But I can see that the government has lost the majority.""

"Narendra Modi flays DMK and Congress, praises MGR and Jayalalithaa","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:36 IST","PALLADAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at DMK and Congress on Tuesday but heaped praises on AIADMK icons MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa signalling that BJP was keeping the option of allying with AIADMK open.
Speaking at the valedictory meeting of BJP state president K Annamalai’s ‘En Mann En Makkal’ padayatra at Madappur near Palladam in Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur district, Modi said MGR was lauded as an incomparable leader by the people of TN because he had given good education and public health.

“He came to power through good deeds, not through dynasty. But the DMK is insulting him today,’’ Modi said, noting that he visited MGR’s place of birth in Sri Lanka during his recent trip to the island nation.
“After MGR, it was `Amma’ Jayalalithaa who gave good governance in Tamil Nadu,’’ the PM said. “She dedicated her entire life for the people of TN. I pay her my tributes. It was because of her service that she lives in the heart of Tamil Nadu people even today,’’ Modi said.

Modi’s speech comes in the backdrop of a shadow boxing between Tamil Nadu BJP and its erstwhile ally AIADMK attempting to poach leaders from each other.
Ever since AIADMK walked out of NDA in September last year, the BJP could not lure any major political parties into its fold in Tamil Nadu, except Tamil Maanila Congress, a light weight in the state. AIADMK has clarified that it will not patch up with BJP again. BJP for its part has begun stitching its own alliance in the state.

Modi’s remarks indicate that the saffron party keeps its option open for an AIADMK alliance.
Hitting out at DMK and Congress, Modi said the fate of INDIA front was sealed in Delhi. But the opposition front was trying to stay alive in TN to “to loot people in TN,” he said.
“It is time to lock their shop which has been opened to loot people,” he said. The right lock meant to shut the DMK – Congress shop has been created using the `En Mann En Makkal’ yatra, he said.
Listing out the welfare programmes -- including two defence corridors -- the BJP-led central government has implemented in TN, he asked if the Congress would implement such development schemes if it came to power. “Will those who received bribes to procure weapons allow development of defence corridors here?’’ he asked.
Modi said BJP had always prioritised growth of TN. “We have given more to TN in the last ten years than what the DMK-Congress alliance had given between 2004 and 2014,” he said. Hence, BJP has captured the hearts of people in TN, though the party was never in power in the state.
That was the reason, those who were looting TN for years are spreading lies, creating confusion and dividing people to hold on to power. “Their drama, however, has been exposed. Their corruption is being brought to light everyday,” he said in an apparent reference to corruption cases against DMK ministers.
Modi said BJP has emerged as a force to reckon with in TN and the party would create history in 2024.
BJP’s allies G K Vasan, A C Shanmugam and Devanathan Yadav were present on the stage along with BJP leaders L Murugan and K Annamalai in the public meeting touted as a biggest show of strength by BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
Modi who landed at Sulur Air Force base in Coimbatore took a chopper to reach the meeting venue. From the helipad he came to the stage, designed like a lotus, on an open jeep waving to the crowd amidst slogans `Vendum Modi, Meendum Modi.’
The yatra inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah in Rameswaram in June last year covered all the assembly constituencies.

"Smriti Mandhana blitz, disciplined bowlers power RCB to 8-wicket win over Gujarat Giants in WPL","Feb 27, 2024, 22:44 IST","NEW DELHI: Skipper Smriti Mandhana's explosive innings and a disciplined bowling performance led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a convincing eight-wicket victory over the struggling Gujarat Giants in their Women's Premier League (WPL) clash in Bengaluru on Tuesday.
Chasing a target of 108 runs, RCB's Mandhana (43, 27 balls, 8x4, 1x6) and S Meghana (36, 28 balls, 5x4, 1x6) formed a solid partnership of 40 runs for the second wicket, effortlessly achieving the target in just 12.3 overs.
This win marked RCB's second consecutive victory in the WPL.

RCB's success was built upon the excellent foundation laid by their bowlers, with pacer Renuka Singh (2/14) and left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux (3/25) being the standout performers after the team opted to bowl. The Giants struggled to post a competitive total, managing only 107 for 7.

Mandhana set the tone for RCB's chase with a powerful start, smashing two fours in the first two balls off pacer Lea Tahuhu. The left-hander's aggressive innings included a well-timed pull and a six over the head of Tahuhu, contributing to RCB amassing 13 runs in the opening over.

Despite losing Sophine Devine in the fourth over, Mandhana continued her onslaught. Although she missed out on a fifty, her entertaining innings highlighted the contrast with the Giants' earlier struggles on the same pitch.

The Giants' captain Beth Mooney (8) fell victim to Renuka's strategic change in line, while Phoebe Litchfield was stumped by Richa Ghosh. Renuka, bowling her full quota of four overs, concluded with impressive figures of 4-0-14-2.

The Giants faced continuous setbacks, losing key wickets, including that of Ashleigh Gardner, hindering their efforts to boost the innings. Dayalan Hemalatha's unbeaten 31 off 25 balls helped the Giants reach just beyond the 100-run mark.
RCB bowlers maintained control throughout the innings, limiting the Giants to only 10 fours and two sixes, underscoring the difficulty the Giants encountered on the field.

The organisation is found continuing its activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty of the nation,” home minister Amit Shah shared in a post on X.
Recalling that the outfit was first declared an ‘unlawful association’ on February 28, 2019, Shah warned that “anyone threatening the security of the nation will face ruthless measures”.
MHA, in its gazette notification extending the ban, referred to a long list of cases against JeI and their leadership/cadres, including the NIA case relating to collection of funds by the outfit for use in encouraging violent and secessionist activities. As per NIA chargesheet, the funds were used by the operatives of terrorist outfits including Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashker e Taiba to organise protests and spread public unrest and communal disharmony.

"Sony lays off hundreds at PlayStation, closes down the London studio","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 20:27 IST","Sony is laying off approximately 900 employees from its PlayStation division, representing around 8% of the unit's global workforce.
In an email to staff, PlayStation President and CEO Jim Ryan called it an ""extremely hard decision"" made after ""careful consideration and many leadership discussions over several months."" Ryan said the layoffs aim to ""streamline resources"" and position the company for ""long-term sustainability.""
""We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community,"" Ryan wrote.

The job cuts will impact employees across all regions where PlayStation operates. Entire studios are being shuttered, including PlayStation's London studio, which focuses on VR games.

PlayStation Studios taking the brunt of layoffs
Layoffs will significantly impact PlayStation's game development studios. Hermen Hulst, Head of PlayStation Studios, confirmed in a separate statement that major studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, and Guerrilla Games will be affected.
""Across our studios, support teams throughout PlayStation and interactive entertainment, reductions will take place,"" Hulst wrote. ""The proposed changes will mean we will part ways with valued colleagues across PS Studios.""

Jim in an email to staff said that all employees involved will be notified of next steps today, and the affected employees will be provided severance benefits. Japan will have a new career support program, with details communicated later.
Specific details on which titles or franchises will be scaled back as a result of the layoffs remain unclear. However, Sony is expected to shift resources away from legacy single-player franchises and toward multiplayer experiences that drive recurring revenue through microtransactions and live services.
PS5 sales miss targets
The job cuts come a few days after Sony’s quarterly earnings call, where the PlayStation maker reported slower-than-expected adoption of the PlayStation 5 console. Sony has slashed its PS5 sales forecast for the year from 25 million units down to just 21 million.
The reduction indicates PlayStation 5 demand is evaporating faster than Sony projected. It also reveals supply chain constraints are finally easing, with Sony able to fulfil more demand if players were still lined up to buy the console.
With PS5 sales lagging internal targets, analysts believe Sony is restructuring to reduce costs and shift its gaming business to be less reliant on hardware revenue.
Sony is expected to release an updated PS5 Pro console later this year, which analysts suggests could help the company boost the sales.
Last year, Playstation laid off staff from a number of their studios, including 100 employees from Bungie, workers from Naughty Dog, and 15-20% of staff at Dreams and LittleBigPlanet studio Media Molecule.
The recent layoffs at PlayStation follow the wave of job cuts across the gaming studios. Sony's gaming rival Microsoft announced in January that it would cut roughly 1,900 jobs, with the axe falling largely on its Activision Blizzard business. Sony's competitor, Nintendo, has not laid off employees and instead has relied on attrition to reduce headcount.

Tax-free meal benefits: Paytm's exit from employee benefits market may open door for competitors - here’s how,"Feb 27, 2024, 17:26 IST","Paytm crisis: Paytm's impending exit from the employee benefits market due to regulatory actions against its payments bank and mobile wallet has paved the way for other players like Pluxee (formerly Sodexo), Zaggle, and banks to grow their presence in this sector.
ET quoted a senior fintech executive saying that large corporations are seeking alternative options for meal benefits due to the upcoming halt in services for Paytm Payments Bank and its wallet after March 15.

Zaggle, a listed startup, aims to onboard 100-150 new corporate clients by the end of the next financial year. In recent months, the company has already begun partnerships with notable entities such as IT company Wipro, staffing solutions provider Quess Corp, private sector lender Axis Bank, and more.
Raj Narayanam, Executive Chairman of Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, noted, “In the meal benefit space, we have seen a massive uptick in demand and given the situation with competition, we have made steady inroads by adding new clients.”

He did not reveal the specific companies that transitioned from Paytm to Zaggle after January 31 when the Reserve Bank of India announced restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank.
Zaggle collaborates with banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, and IndusInd Bank to provide prepaid payment services to its corporate clients. In addition to meal vouchers and employee benefits, Zaggle also offers companies a spending management tool.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the company recorded a net profit of Rs 24.8 crore on operational revenue of Rs 502 crore. Presently, its market capitalization stands at around Rs 4,200 crore.

Industry insiders told the financial daily that Pluxee, the employee benefit business recently hived off from Sodexo, is also aiming to capitalise on new opportunities arising from the developments at Paytm Payments Bank.
A Pluxee spokesperson stated that its food wallet business has been experiencing substantial year-on-year growth, pre-dating the Paytm issue. However, they declined to comment on any specific increase in business following January 31.
Queries sent via email to Paytm received no response.
Changing landscape of employee benefits
Disruptions in the employee benefits space have highlighted the significance of tax-free meal benefits under India's tax regulations. Many companies provide a portion of employees' salaries as tax-free benefits, loading the funds into prepaid wallets linked to cards for transactions. These cards are restricted to use at merchant outlets selling food and beverages.
Various players, including French majors like Sodexo and Edenred, along with fintech startups like Zeta, have been key players in this domain. However, recent shifts, including Edenred India relinquishing its licence and Zeta selling its meal benefit business to Sodexo, have reshaped the competitive landscape.
HDFC Bank provides Foodplus meal cards, and ICICI Bank offers its meal cards. Sodexo recently spun off its meal benefits business as Pluxee. In recent years, Paytm has become a dominant fintech player in this sector.
The fintech executive mentioned earlier stated, “Paytm with its superior wallet offering and acceptance across the country had managed to grab a large market share in this business and was second competing with Sodexo, but now the leader board is set to get disrupted; Zaggle is trying to grab that space.”
Paytm provided the option for corporations to create sub-wallets for various expenses such as food, fuel, and similar items. Leveraging the popularity of the app and its extensive network of merchants, employees found it convenient to access and use funds easily.

Employee benefits industry: Margins, market size and compliance
The employee benefit industry presents an attractive opportunity for payment players, although profit margins in this segment are notably slim. To generate profits in this sector, companies often require ancillary services to supplement revenue. For Paytm, this niche business represented a small fraction of its broader fintech offerings, aiding its penetration into enterprises. Zaggle provides comprehensive spend management solutions, while Sodexo maintains diversified business interests spanning facilities management.
According to industry estimates, the current market size of this industry is approximately Rs 1 lakh crore in disbursements, benefiting roughly 15-18 million consumers. Some large companies make significant disbursements annually.
An executive was quoted anonymously saying that one of the largest financial services companies in the country disburses around Rs 1,500 crore every year to its employees, primarily for meal benefits.
The most critical aspect of this business is ensuring proper KYC of the final user, who is the employee, and guaranteeing that the funds are used at the appropriate places.
Raj Narayanam of Zaggle mentioned that tracking very small value payments based on merchant codes becomes challenging when using QR code-based payments. However, compliance is better managed through prepaid cards.
A senior HR executive at a large corporation stated that moving forward, most large companies will choose to engage with multiple vendors to mitigate the risk of disruption.
This person further added that banks are also advocating for sincere KYC of the final user of the wallet and clear understanding of its usage.",Times Of India

""We'll keep chiselling away at those rough edges. It's not a bad time to be coach of the England team,"" he said.
Ollie Robinson's Test future is uncertain following a lackluster performance in Ranchi, but McCullum has expressed confidence in the out-of-form Jonny Bairstow to make a significant impact in Dharamsala, where he is set to play his 100th game.
Bairstow stands as the only English batter who has not played a substantial innings in the Test series against India. Although the series outcome is already beyond England's grasp, impactful runs from Bairstow's bat would be highly appreciated. So far, his highest score in eight innings is 38, achieved in the first innings of the Ranchi Test.

""It'll be really emotional for him,"" said McCullum in reference to Bairstow's landmark game.

""Everyone knows Jonny's story. He is quite an emotional character at times and big milestones like that do mean a lot to him. (In this match) he walked taller, looked stronger, had that presence and that real Jonny Bairstow swagger to him. When he has that you kind of feel he's never too far away.""
Talking about pacer Robinson, who had a forgettable first outing in the series, the New Zealander said: ""Everything he did leading into the Test match suggested we'd see not just the Ollie Robinson we'd seen previously but a better version of it.
""For one reason or another it didn't quite work out for him. Obviously he's not just as disappointed as everyone else, he's the most disappointed out of everyone.""
Robinson went wicketless in the 12 overs he bowled in the first innings and was not used in the second essay.

He was all praise for rookie spinners Tom Hartley and Shoaib Bashir who exceeded expectations with a combine tally of 32 wickets in the first four Tests. Hartley in fact is the leading wicket taker in the series with 20 scalps.
""It will be a slight frustration of ours if they weren't given opportunities at county level. There's a very real possibility that might be the case but without wanting to dictate to counties because they have their own agendas as well.
""(But) I think you'd be slightly mad if you didn't give them more opportunities in county cricket,"" hoped McCullum.
Seamers tend to dominate county cricket in which spinners like Bashir and Hartley have a limited role to play.

Won't allow child marriage as long as I'm alive: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11 IST","GUWAHATI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in the assembly on Monday that he will not allow any child marriage in the state as long as he is alive.
""I want to make it loud and clear that till the time I am there, I will not allow you (Opposition) to play with the future of innocent Muslim children. I will bring an end to this exploitative business and will not allow a single child marriage to take place in Assam.""
He added, ""We will completely close the shop that you people have opened to ruin the daughters of the Muslim community by 2026.""

A IUDF MLA Karim Uddin Barbhuiya pleaded with speaker Biswajit Daimary to allow the adjournment motion on the decision to repeal the “Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act”. However, the speaker rejected it saying the matter is yet to be brought in the House.
This was also supported by Congress members of the House. Leader of the Opposition in the assembly and senior Congress leader, Debabrata Saikia, said the House should have been informed before taking any cabinet decision at a time when a session is undergoing. Responding to this, CM Sarma said, “We have not done anything outside the rule.
The rule is that a bill is first approved in the cabinet and then introduced in the House. We want to repeal the Act because it has provision of child marriage. A cabinet decision has been taken. The bill is yet to be introduced in the House.” Following this, the Congress MLAs walked out of the assembly, while the AIUDF MLAs staged a sit-in before the speaker.

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.

A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India
"Life for Russian political prisoners: 'Isolation, poor food & arbitrary punishment'","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:13 IST","Vladimir Kara-Murza could only laugh when officials in Penal Colony No. 6 inexplicably put a small cabinet in his already-cramped concrete cell, next to a fold-up cot, stool, sink and latrine. That moment of dark humour came because the only things he had to store in it were a toothbrush and a mug, said his wife, Yevgenia, since the opposition activist wasn't allowed any personal items in solitary confinement.

Another time, she said, Kara-Murza was told to collect his bedding from across the corridor - except that prisoners must keep their hands behind their backs whenever outside their cells. ""How was he supposed to pick it up? With his teeth?"" Yevgenia said. When he collected the sheets, a guard appeared and told him he violated the rules, bringing more discipline. Kara-Murza was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence for a Kremlin critic.
For political prisoners like Kara-Murza, life in Russia's penal colonies is a grim reality of physical and psychological pressure, sleep deprivation, insufficient food, health care that is poor or simply denied, and a dizzying set of arbitrary rules.
According to Memorial - a group founded to document repression, there are 680 political prisoners in Russia who are being held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's crackdown. This month brought the stunning news from a remote Arctic penal colony, one of Russia's harshest facilities: the still-unexplained death of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's fiercest foe.

Most often, inmates live in barracks tightly packed with bunk beds. Konstantin Kotov, an activist who spent over a year in Penal Colony No. 2 , recalls cramped quarters of 60 men per room. Meals are unsatisfying: Breakfast was porridge, lunch was soup with little or no meat, mashed potatoes and a meat or fish cutlet; as was dinner. Inmates got two eggs a week, and fruit and vegetables were a luxury. Reports of physical abuse are common for ordinary inmates but rare for political prisoners, advocates say. Instead, intimidation often comes via enforcing minor infractions. Navalny spent months in a punishment cell for not buttoning his uniform properly or not putting his hands behind his back. He once described it as a ""concrete kennel"" of 8-by-10-feet that, depending on the season, was ""cold and damp,"" or ""hot and there's almost no air"".

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.
Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam. The aspirants from rural areas are not likely to face difficulty as all facilities are available in every nook and corner,” says Pathak.
The Commission said that the name of the candidate and the date on which the photograph was taken must also be mentioned clearly on the photograph. The faces of the candidates should also occupy three-fourths of the space in the photograph, the official notification said.
The Commission has also asked the candidates to make sure that their appearance matches their photograph at each stage of the examination process – Preliminary, Mains (written) and Interview or Personality test. For instance, if a candidate uploads a bearded photograph, he must appear with the same look in the Preliminary, Mains (Written) and Interview/Personality Test. Same would be the case with spectacles, moustaches, etc.
Candidates who wish to apply for the Civil Service Examination=Preliminary 2024 for about 1,056 vacant posts, can visit the official website at upsc.gov.in and submit the application form. Candidates scoring above the cut-off marks in CSE prelims will become eligible to register for the main examination. The mains will be descriptive and will be conducted from September 20 for five days.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Focus is on offering solutions against selling the products: Dinesh K Khara, Chairman, State Bank of India","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:44:00 AM IST","Much-needed private investments to quicken the pace of economic expansion are just ‘around the corner’, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara tells Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan, pointing to aggregate capacity utilisation reaching thresholds that have historically prompted corporate boards to draw up expansion plans.

Mumbai-based SBI, which reported record profits topping Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal year, is the winner of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in the Company of the Year category. In an interview touching upon a wide range of topics, Khara tells ET that India’s focus on building manufacturing muscle would further strengthen the growth capex trend and, in turn, banks that are expected to help finance India's spectacular and exciting journey along the competitiveness gradient. Edited excerpts:


There are a couple of reasons — a part of it comes from the macro and some part of it from the contribution from all the SBIians. It's more like a citizenship of the bank. Since the macro was doing well in terms of the demand which was demonstrated during Covid and also the enabling ecosystem created by the government, it created a very positive environment for the bank. Covid was the first test of resilience of the banking system and of the State Bank of India. The other piece was the positivity in the organisation that helped us in getting the best out of everyone at SBI. And when they started tasting success, their confidence improved. Ensuring the timely delivery and keeping a very close eye in terms of the quality of the loan book helped us in generating interest income where we were not required to make any provisions.


During Covid there were not enough opportunities for lending. But at the same time there are enough deposits. We went for the rupee dollar swaps and we supported our international balance sheet. We got into supply chain financing activity in our overseas operation. When we could see the demand coming up in India, we unwound those rupee dollar swaps and brought the money back and supported the growth in the domestic economy.


During Covid there was a reasonable demand we saw for retail growth. We looked at opportunities and worked out what all solutions we can offer. So orientation was changed in terms of offering solutions as against selling the products. We were quite cognizant of the fact that recovery of the economy will depend upon the growth of the SMEs. So, we started investing in terms of the infrastructure for SME, and ensured that each of the zonal offices of the bank, which are more than 100 across the country, had a AGM level officer who was responsible for SME loans and brought the sanctioning committees nearer to the ground. We had taken up the task to scale up this SME business to around `4 lakh crore and I am happy to share that today we have already crossed the `4 lakh crore and much before the financial year 2023-24 target we had set. Our SME book has got perhaps one of the lowest gross NPA which is at 4.33%.


We looked at the opportunities available and ensured that we have adequate infrastructure in place to ensure that we underwrite a quality book and we should have effective follow up... We came out with the loan management system. Now we have brought in the business division in SME. We came out with the pre-approved business loans. So we did a lot of work in this space and that is the reason why we can now see a Rs 4 lakh crore book which is very strong in terms of quality.


Our agri book was also stagnating for many years at about Rs 2 lakh crore. At that point of time we said that we should take it to Rs 3 lakh crore and today we are almost at that number — Rs 2.92 lakh crore.

In terms of quality also, even in this book we used to have high gross NPA, now it has been brought into the single digit. In the SME space, we also took help from our large corporate relationships. We started mapping their vendor distributor ecosystem end to end so that they will have a very dependable supply chain and also at the same time we would have the visibility of the cash flows for these enterprises.


There are a couple of things which have taken place in the ecosystem and this is essentially coming from the credit bureaus, particularly in the retail segment. Credit bureaus have changed the trajectory because there is enough and the clear visibility in terms of the credit history of the borrower. In retail, one should have the system structure in place unless and until the structure is well oiled, there can be challenges in retail. So that is the reason why we invested well in the structure. All our retail loans we have got the loan management system which are end to end digital and also it leaves hardly any discussion on ground and they are all having the business rule in general embedded into it. So when the scale goes up, there has to be uniformity in the underwriting standards. That is the reason why in our retail book, the gross NPA is actually less than 0.70%.


When it comes to private capex, there are different stages. Normally, it comes to the drawing board when the capacity utilization reaches somewhere around 75%. If we look at some of the numbers in 2022-23, we have seen the capital commitment to the tune of Rs 37 lakh crore by the private corporates. Also in the first half it is around Rs 20 lakh crore. When it comes to the growth in numbers there is always a lag between corporate credit and capital commitment. Once people have got a clear visibility of the demand, they start evaluating the options relating to the capex. The undisbursed limits for the term loans have been released. So that's a very clear reflection that there is a definite departure as compared to the past. That gives us the confidence that the private capex is just around the corner.


All the initiatives which have been taken by the government in terms of the infrastructure creation has also created an enabling environment because eventually the road and rail infrastructure which is getting created will lead to a situation where the logistic cost is going to come down. They are aiming to bring it down by half to about 7% and I think they are much on course. There is a very clear focus of orienting this economy to become manufacturing oriented. That also is going to be one of the other factors leading to even more capex commitments also.


We are quite well placed at current levels at somewhere around 67-68%. The RBI is not prescribing any credit deposit ratio, but nevertheless, there has to be enough deposit base so that there is enough muscle in the banking system to lend. What I expect is banks will be even more careful, and choosy in terms of picking up the assets which they should support. So that is something that appears to be the potential outcome.


CASA before Covid used to be around 40% in the system, so, I would say that it is actually coming back to the same levels after going to around 44% during Covid because there were not enough opportunities for people to spend money. Now people are coming back to spending habits. That's one aspect. The second aspect is that invariably we have seen that during inflationary times, there is a tendency on the part of all savers to put their money in high interest earning assets class. It is a part of the cycle.


Banking system would be Rs 200 lakh crore, mutual fund industry would be about Rs 50 lakh crore, life insurance is about Rs 60 lakh crore. Pension fund is about Rs 10 lakh crore, and I think when it comes to the stock market, it would be about Rs 300 odd lakh crore. That is the broad composition. Even if youngsters are putting their money into SIP, they will route it through the banking system. That money in any case has to be channelised through the system only. There will be competition vis-a-vis the fixed deposit but it is the financial literacy which will perhaps eventually guide.


Competition is a reality which none of us can ignore and obviously when it comes to banking to strike a fine balance between the cost of deposit and the returns which they will generate. So the fact remains that if at all you want to maintain the excellent asset quality, you should be in a position to lend at the most competitive rates and for lending at the most competitive rates, you must be in a position to keep a check on your cost of resources. It is a very fine balance which people have to maintain because there are multiple stakeholders whose aspirations must be honored.


In the retail segment, growth was at a very high pace, at about 30% for many of the entities and that too in the very low ticket size. A little greater analysis revealed that much of it was being given based upon the spending patterns, whereas prudent lending principle suggests that it should be based upon the ability of people to repay, which means that their EMI to NMI (Net Monthly Income) ratio becomes very critical. That is the reason why perhaps RBI came down on the unsecured loans. Such entities were not having enough recovery mechanisms in place. RBI came down with such prescriptions to ensure that there should be orderly growth in the system and there should not be unhealthy growth.


Across the globe, the financial sector is very tightly regulated. The safety and security of the system is a function of the safety and security of all the players who are there in the ecosystem. FinTechs have a capability, they are very agile, they are in a position to offer solutions to a problem and to that extent, they actually create value for the system. As an entity, we are consuming the services of Fintech. But, yes of course, being a regulated entity, this is something which is on the top of our mind always, that anything which we do, it should be in line with what is the prescription from the regulator. Whereas as a part of DNA, they are more independent in terms of their thinking, in terms of offering solutions. It is for the mutual benefit for fintechs to understand and appreciate the ecosystem and the regulatory environment and for entities like banks to consume their services so that even banks become nimble. Fintechs can, you know, play second fiddle or substitute the bank's efforts rather than trying to be something on their own.


We have to stay ahead of the curve and for that we have to keep on investing in terms of understanding the evolving trends and how we should strengthen our risk management capabilities. Even in the good times, we are having a sharper focus on the risk management capability of the bank and we are investing well in terms of understanding the risk. We are having this sort of modelling for all kinds of risks. For the time being things look perfectly okay. We should have the mitigants in place. The fundamental principle is that the balance sheet should always remain strong",The economic times
CCI proposes changes to confidential info sharing,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 AM IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has proposed to amend the so-called ""confidentiality ring"" regime that governs the treatment of confidential information in its proceedings, seeking to streamline the processes and prevent any delays in disposal of cases.

The regime, introduced in 2022, allows parties involved in a case to have access to confidential information or documents relating to other parties in an investigation to better defend themselves, subject to riders.

The draft regulations released by the anti-trust regulator have set a time frame for seeking and granting access to confidential information.

The CCI has proposed that the party seeking access to confidential information must request for setting up a confidentiality ring at the earliest. If such a request is made by a party after the receipt of the non-confidential version of the investigation report, it will be made within seven days, with a provision to give another 7 days, subject to conditions. The regulator has sought stakeholder comments on the draft proposals until March 27.

Neelambera Sandeepan, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said the proposed amendments aim to ""prevent delays caused in enforcement proceedings on account of accessibility of confidential documents"". They also specify conditions and circumstances as to when the confidentiality rings can be set up, she said.

A party seeking confidentiality over the information or documents furnished by it will set out cogent reasons for such a treatment, the draft said. The party must specify the date on which such confidential treatment will expire on a self-certification basis, it said.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

""A merit-based immigration system that protects American labour and promotes American values"" is what Trump has pledged to pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he suspended numerous work visas and implemented measures to restrict access to certain visa programs during his first time in office.",The economic times
States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.

However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a fiscal deficit target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.

The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

The states have so far drawn down 31.5 per cent more debt this fiscal at Rs 8.143 lakh crore as against Rs 6.193 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:57:00 AM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.


“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:


US markets

The Dow led Wall Street lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

At 09:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.05 points, or 0.26%, at 38,967.18, the S&P 500 was down 2.79 points, or 0.06%, at 5,066.74, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.59 points, or 0.05%, at 15,967.67.

European Markets

European shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in basic resources stocks and a string of upbeat earnings, while investors and central bankers braced for inflation data this week that could alter the course for interest rates.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ticked up 0.1% by 9:35 GMT, while Germany's benchmark DAX climbed 0.4%, logging another record high.

Investors are taking a pause after last week's surge in artificial intelligence-driven buying which propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high.

Tech View

In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.

Ruling BJP kills two birds with one stone in Uttar Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:49:00 AM IST","Lucknow: BJP's strategy to bring SP MLAs to its side and garner the magic number for the victory of its eighth Rajya Sabha candidate also conceals a well-thought-out plan of strengthening itself in some weak Lok Sabha seats to which some MLAs belong, while giving a jolt to Samajwadi Party's morale ahead of the general elections.

At least seven SP MLAs are suspected to have cross-voted for BJP's candidates on Tuesday. The spadework for Tuesday likely began at least a fortnight ago, after which, assured of extra support, Sanjay Seth was brought in as the surprise eighth candidate by BJP. The party needed eight extra votes for Seth's win. Alarm bells first rang when eight SP MLAs skipped the dinner hosted by chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday and remained unreachable. On Tuesday morning, the first blow was dealt by SP MLA from Unchahar, Raebareli, Manoj Pandey, who resigned from the post of chief whip of the party before the voting commenced. Later, these MLAs were seen posing with deputy CM Brajesh Pathak confirming all doubts. Akhilesh Yadav declared that all who have cross-voted will be ousted from the party.

Observers say BJP has achieved two objectives. Not only will this deal a blow to SP, some MLAs, who have cross-voted and will likely be seen in BJP in the coming days, represent parts of Lok Sabha seats which BJP views as a challenge like Raebareli and Ambedkarnagar.

Apart from Raebareli Sadar assembly seat which is represented by BJP's Aditi Singh, all the remaining four assembly seats of the Raebareli LS constituency are occupied by SP, in what could have made it an uphill battle for BJP, coupled with the fact that it is a Congress bastion. Pandey's switchover, considering his credentials as a strong Brahmin face, will provide a significant boost to the party's prospects there and he may even be fielded as the BJP candidate from the seat, as is being speculated.

Top BJP leaders head to Bihar as Lok Sabha polls draw near,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:33:00 AM IST","New Delhi: Within a fortnight beginning Wednesday, BJP's top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, will address public meetings in Bihar as part of BJP-led NDA's aim to win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The coalition, which won 39 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming for a clean sweep bolstered by JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar's return.

On March 2, Modi will address two public meetings in Aurangabad and Begusarai. This will be his first visit to Bihar after Kumar switched sides and rejoined NDA. Modi and Kumar will share the stage in Aurangabad after a long time.

Singh will visit Bihar on Wednesday. He will visit Sitamarhi and Darbhanga to address meetings. On Thursday, Shah will review poll preparedness and address a meeting of party workers near Patna.

The opposition camp too is planning a show of strength with a joint rally in Patna on March 3 in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to participate. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been touring the state as part of his Jan Vishwas Yatra, which will conclude on February 29.

"Shami undergoes ankle surgery, set to miss IPL","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:31:00 AM IST","Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami has undergone a successful surgery on his left achilles tendon, which rules him out of next month's Indian Premier League and possibly the T20 World Cup in June. The 33-year-old, who last played for India in the ODI World Cup final against Australia on November 19, went under the knife in London on Monday.

Shami, who is eager to ""get back on my feet soon"" stares at a recovery time of a minimum of three months.

He will thus miss the IPL slated to be played from March 22 to May 26, as reported by PTI last week.

Shami is also a doubtful starter for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.

""Just had a successful heel operation on my achilles tendon! Recovery is going to take some time, but looking forward to getting back on my feet,"" Shami tweeted, along with several pictures of him in the hospital, on X on Monday.

— MdShami11 (@MdShami11)

Shami, who was one of the architects of India's stupendous ODI World Cup campaign with 24 wickets, had played through pain as he had problems with his landing but didn't let it affect his performance.

He had flown to London in January to take special ankle injections. However, the medication didn't work and the fast bowler had to opt for surgery.

The absence of Shami is a major blow for Gujarat Titans, who have also traded all-rounder Hardik Pandya to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash deal. Shami was the side's highest wicket-taker during their runner-up finish in IPL last year.

Shami, who was recently conferred with the Arjuna Award, has 229 Test, 195 ODI and 24 T20 wickets in his decade-long career.

The development raises a question mark about the injury rehabilitation management programme planned by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for Shami.

It is also highly unlikely that the pacer would be able to make a comeback before India's Test matches at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand (October November).

His target could be the marquee away series against Australia.

Army called in amid fresh tension in Manipur; Assam Rifles deployed after senior cop abducted briefly,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:25:00 AM IST","The Army was called in as fresh tension mounted in Manipur on Tuesday and four columns of the Assam Rifles were deployed in Imphal East after a senior police officer was abducted allegedly by cadres of the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation, from his residence, officials said. The officer, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumar, posted in the operations wing of the Manipur Police, was rescued after a swift action by police and security forces, the officials said.

The officer has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

Giving details of the incident that took place around 7 pm on Tuesday, the officials said that a group of cadres owing allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol attacked the house of Kumar at Wangkhei in Imphal East.

The reason for this indiscriminate firing was that the officer concerned had arrested six members of the group for their alleged involvement in vehicle theft, the officials said.

Following the arrests, a group of Meira Paibis (Meitei women group) had protested and blocked roads demanding their release.

In the Tuesday evening attack, armed cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol ransacked the house and damaged at least four vehicles with gunfire, they said.

Detailing the chaotic events, M Kulla, the police officer's father, explained, ""We tried to talk to the armed men after they entered, but all of a sudden they started firing at the vehicles and properties. So we had to rush inside and lock ourselves.""

The father, according to the officials, called his son and informed about the incident.

The officer rushed with his team only to be abducted as they were outnumbered by the cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol.

The Manipur Police acted promptly, mobilising forces to launch a successful rescue operation, ensuring Kumar's safe return within hours.

The state government had to take help of the Army as the situation worded after the rescue efforts.

Officials said that four columns of the Assam Rifles were requisitioned and deployed around the area where the incident took place. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is not applicable in valley areas.

The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, functions under the operational command of the Army.

The region has witnessed escalating violence since May 3, with over 180 casualties reported after a ""Tribal Solidarity March"" in the hill districts protested the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

The Meiteis, constituting around 53 per cent of Manipur's population and residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, contrast the tribals, including Nagas and Kukis, who make up 40 per cent and primarily inhabit the hill districts.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. runs McDonald's in western India and South India. operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.",The economic times
NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

BJP wins eight Rajya Sabha seats; SP bags two seats in UP,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:04:00 PM IST","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday won eight, out of ten, Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, SP bagged two seats in the state.

Voting in the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh began around 9 am on Tuesday. The BJP had fielded eight candidates and the Samajwadi Party (SP) three.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

"Rajya Sabha Polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP bags one in Karnataka","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:24:00 PM IST","In a closely contested electoral battle in Karnataka, all three Congress candidates emerged victorious. The three candidates- Ajay Maken, Dr. Syed Naseer Hussain, and GC Chandrashekhar- secured wins with slender margins, receiving 47, 46, and 46 votes respectively.

Voting in the elections for the four Rajya Sabha seats in Karnataka began Tuesday at 9 am. The counting began at 5pm.

The Congress had 133 MLAs, the BJP has 66, JD (S) 19, while others account for four.

Of the four others, the Congress claimed the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and was confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.

The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members - Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP and G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah from the Congress.

The Congress, which was confident of winning three seats had fielded G C Chandrashekhar, Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken.

The BJP had fielded Narayansa Bhandage as also JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy as the NDA candidate which had made the election interesting.

Congress sources claimed that the party has the support of four others, reported PTI.

""Besides, we may get three votes from the rival camp,"" a top Congress source told PTI.

Fearing cross-voting, the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance huddled their MLAs in a private resort on Monday.

They also conducted a workshop for the new members to inform them about the election process and how to cast their votes.

All parties have issued whips to the MLAs, who are the voters in Tuesday's poll, amid apprehensions of cross-voting.

According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, the preference votes kick in.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.

Your business model is aimed at consistently expanding the product portfolio to cater to multiple end-use applications. Can you tell us more about your product pipeline?
Krishna Dushyant Rana: Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.

Can you tell us if there are any specific investments or expansion you are looking at from the proceeds of the IPO.
Krishna Dushyant Rana: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for PVC Stabilizers in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance shareholder value.

You are currently one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of PVC stabilizers in India. What are the global ambitions looking like?
Krishna Dushyant Rana: As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.

What is your vision for Platinum Industries over the next few years?
Krishna Dushyant Rana: Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

The step was taken in order to develop the onshore rupee non-deliverable derivatives contract market and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently plan their hedging activities, the RBI said.

Such transactions would be cash-settled in rupees and shall have the flexibility of cash settlement between two relevant banks and between a bank and a person residing outside India in rupees or any foreign currency.",The economic times
Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Also read: ICICI Bank branch manager duped depositors of crores for years to meet targets.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times

Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru."" The biggest challenge, he pointed out, for such projects specially in metros like Delhi, is land acquisition, said Bhagat.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

Indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge inducted into Indian Army,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:56:00 PM IST","A 46-metre indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge was inducted into the Indian Army on Tuesday, a move that will bolster the crucial bridging capability of the force's engineers. The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

"Elon Musk raises his Microsoft 'customer care' complaint directly to Satya Nadella, here's what he said","Feb 27, 2024, 16:23 IST","Clearly the text didn’t seem to have worked. Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

"They supped & drank together on Monday night, backstabbed me on Tuesday, says Abhishek Singhvi","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:32 IST","NEW DELHI: Abhishek Singhvi may be used to winning the knottiest of legal cases but on Tuesday, what he thought was a 'win' soon turned out to be a loss.
As the candidate for the lone HP seat, he ended up in an unexpected tie with rival Harsh Mahajan, thanks to cross-voting by some MLAs, necessitating a draw of lots to decide the result. As luck, or rather ill-luck, would have it, Singhvi did win the draw of lots, only to get eliminated in a cruel twist of fate.
The unusual way to pick a winner in the event of equal votes polled by candidates where only one RS seat is to be filled is thanks to Rule 75(4) of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.
As per the rule, where two or more candidates get same value of votes for a lone RS seat, the candidate with the lowest number of original votes, where this number is same for all, is to be excluded by a draw of lots.
""The RO puts slips with names of the candidates in a box, which is shaken before the slips are drawn. The candidate whose slip is drawn is eliminated/excluded, and whose slip remains in the box is declared winner,"" an EC functionary explained. ""It is written in the stars and written by God. In a normal draw of lots, the name taken out wins. Under strange rule of EC the name taken out of the box, which was mine, loses... is excluded,"" Singhvi later said at a press conference.
Singhvi said the nine MLAs who voted against him were with him and other party leaders even on Monday night, where they ""supped and drank together"". He said the experience of betrayal has taught him ""about human character, its fickleness and resoluteness both"".
He lashed out at BJP's ""new India"" philosophy of winning elections at all costs, ""more by crook, than by hook"".

"Narendra Modi flays DMK and Congress, praises MGR and Jayalalithaa","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:36 IST","PALLADAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at DMK and Congress on Tuesday but heaped praises on AIADMK icons MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa signalling that BJP was keeping the option of allying with AIADMK open.
Speaking at the valedictory meeting of BJP state president K Annamalai’s ‘En Mann En Makkal’ padayatra at Madappur near Palladam in Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur district, Modi said MGR was lauded as an incomparable leader by the people of TN because he had given good education and public health.

“He came to power through good deeds, not through dynasty. But the DMK is insulting him today,’’ Modi said, noting that he visited MGR’s place of birth in Sri Lanka during his recent trip to the island nation.
“After MGR, it was `Amma’ Jayalalithaa who gave good governance in Tamil Nadu,’’ the PM said. “She dedicated her entire life for the people of TN. I pay her my tributes. It was because of her service that she lives in the heart of Tamil Nadu people even today,’’ Modi said.

Modi’s speech comes in the backdrop of a shadow boxing between Tamil Nadu BJP and its erstwhile ally AIADMK attempting to poach leaders from each other.
Ever since AIADMK walked out of NDA in September last year, the BJP could not lure any major political parties into its fold in Tamil Nadu, except Tamil Maanila Congress, a light weight in the state. AIADMK has clarified that it will not patch up with BJP again. BJP for its part has begun stitching its own alliance in the state.

Modi’s remarks indicate that the saffron party keeps its option open for an AIADMK alliance.
Hitting out at DMK and Congress, Modi said the fate of INDIA front was sealed in Delhi. But the opposition front was trying to stay alive in TN to “to loot people in TN,” he said.
“It is time to lock their shop which has been opened to loot people,” he said. The right lock meant to shut the DMK – Congress shop has been created using the `En Mann En Makkal’ yatra, he said.
Listing out the welfare programmes -- including two defence corridors -- the BJP-led central government has implemented in TN, he asked if the Congress would implement such development schemes if it came to power. “Will those who received bribes to procure weapons allow development of defence corridors here?’’ he asked.
Modi said BJP had always prioritised growth of TN. “We have given more to TN in the last ten years than what the DMK-Congress alliance had given between 2004 and 2014,” he said. Hence, BJP has captured the hearts of people in TN, though the party was never in power in the state.
That was the reason, those who were looting TN for years are spreading lies, creating confusion and dividing people to hold on to power. “Their drama, however, has been exposed. Their corruption is being brought to light everyday,” he said in an apparent reference to corruption cases against DMK ministers.
Modi said BJP has emerged as a force to reckon with in TN and the party would create history in 2024.
BJP’s allies G K Vasan, A C Shanmugam and Devanathan Yadav were present on the stage along with BJP leaders L Murugan and K Annamalai in the public meeting touted as a biggest show of strength by BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
Modi who landed at Sulur Air Force base in Coimbatore took a chopper to reach the meeting venue. From the helipad he came to the stage, designed like a lotus, on an open jeep waving to the crowd amidst slogans `Vendum Modi, Meendum Modi.’
The yatra inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah in Rameswaram in June last year covered all the assembly constituencies.

Astronauts on Isro's Gaganyaan mission trained at same centre in Russia where Rakesh Sharma underwent training,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 20:08 IST","NEW DELHI: The first four astronauts for Isro's groundbreaking human spaceflight initiative, Gaganyaan, underwent comprehensive training at Russia's Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center — a historical centre where Rakesh Sharma, India's pioneer in space, had previously trained in 1984.
PM Modi inaugurates 3 major ISRO projects: India to have its own space station by 2025

Located in Star City, just north of Moscow, the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center is renowned for its cutting-edge facilities, encompassing integrated simulators and diverse survival training scenarios, including those in mountains, woodlands, marshes, deserts, the Arctic, and at sea.

First and only Indian in space
Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma flew aboard the Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. He is the only Indian citizen to travel in space.
The Soyuz T-11 spacecraft carrying cosmonauts, including Sharma, docked with the Salyut 7 Orbital Station. Sharma spent 7 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes aboard the Salyut 7 during which his team conducted scientific and technical studies which included forty-three experimental sessions. His work was mainly in the fields of bio-medicine and remote sensing.

'Sare Jahan Se Accha'
The crew held a joint television news conference with officials in Moscow and then PM Indira Gandhi.
When Indira Gandhi asked Sharma how India looked from outer space, he replied, ""Sare Jahan Se Accha"" (the best in the world)"".
With Sharma's voyage aboard Soyuz T-11, India became the 14th nation to send a man to outer space.
Four astronauts named for Gaganyaan mission
During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kerala on Tuesday, he revealed the names of the selected Indian Air Force pilots set to embark on the Gaganyaan mission: Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla.
The announcement took place at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, where PM Modi not only reviewed the ongoing progress of the Gaganyaan mission but also conferred 'astronaut wings' upon the designated crew.

Gaganyaan, scheduled for launch in 2024-25, holds the objective of showcasing India's human spaceflight capabilities by sending a crew into a 400 km orbit for a three-day mission and safely returning them to Earth—landing in Indian sea waters.
The mission necessitates the development of critical technologies, including a human-rated launch vehicle, life support systems, and provisions for crew safety during emergencies.
In his address at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, PM Modi highlighted the significant strides made by India in space exploration and underscored the transformative role of the Gaganyaan project in elevating the nation's standing in the global space sector.
The mission's success will not only mark a historic achievement for India but also contribute to inspiring a scientific temperament among the country's youth.

The year 2023 witnessed India's prowess in space exploration with the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon's South Pole and the launch of Aditya-L1, the country's maiden solar mission. These accomplishments not only solidified India's position in the global space economy but also acted as catalysts for the burgeoning private space sector within the country.
Looking ahead, India's ambitious plans include the establishment of the 'Bharatiya Antariksha Station' by 2035 and sending the first Indian astronaut to the Moon by 2040.
These visionary initiatives signify India's commitment to advancing its capabilities in space exploration and cementing its position as a formidable player in the realm of cosmic exploration.

"Sony lays off hundreds at PlayStation, closes down the London studio","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 20:27 IST","Sony is laying off approximately 900 employees from its PlayStation division, representing around 8% of the unit's global workforce.
In an email to staff, PlayStation President and CEO Jim Ryan called it an ""extremely hard decision"" made after ""careful consideration and many leadership discussions over several months."" Ryan said the layoffs aim to ""streamline resources"" and position the company for ""long-term sustainability.""
""We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community,"" Ryan wrote.

The job cuts will impact employees across all regions where PlayStation operates. Entire studios are being shuttered, including PlayStation's London studio, which focuses on VR games.

PlayStation Studios taking the brunt of layoffs
Layoffs will significantly impact PlayStation's game development studios. Hermen Hulst, Head of PlayStation Studios, confirmed in a separate statement that major studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac Games, and Guerrilla Games will be affected.
""Across our studios, support teams throughout PlayStation and interactive entertainment, reductions will take place,"" Hulst wrote. ""The proposed changes will mean we will part ways with valued colleagues across PS Studios.""

Jim in an email to staff said that all employees involved will be notified of next steps today, and the affected employees will be provided severance benefits. Japan will have a new career support program, with details communicated later.
Specific details on which titles or franchises will be scaled back as a result of the layoffs remain unclear. However, Sony is expected to shift resources away from legacy single-player franchises and toward multiplayer experiences that drive recurring revenue through microtransactions and live services.
PS5 sales miss targets
The job cuts come a few days after Sony’s quarterly earnings call, where the PlayStation maker reported slower-than-expected adoption of the PlayStation 5 console. Sony has slashed its PS5 sales forecast for the year from 25 million units down to just 21 million.
The reduction indicates PlayStation 5 demand is evaporating faster than Sony projected. It also reveals supply chain constraints are finally easing, with Sony able to fulfil more demand if players were still lined up to buy the console.
With PS5 sales lagging internal targets, analysts believe Sony is restructuring to reduce costs and shift its gaming business to be less reliant on hardware revenue.
Sony is expected to release an updated PS5 Pro console later this year, which analysts suggests could help the company boost the sales.
Last year, Playstation laid off staff from a number of their studios, including 100 employees from Bungie, workers from Naughty Dog, and 15-20% of staff at Dreams and LittleBigPlanet studio Media Molecule.
The recent layoffs at PlayStation follow the wave of job cuts across the gaming studios. Sony's gaming rival Microsoft announced in January that it would cut roughly 1,900 jobs, with the axe falling largely on its Activision Blizzard business. Sony's competitor, Nintendo, has not laid off employees and instead has relied on attrition to reduce headcount.

Tax-free meal benefits: Paytm's exit from employee benefits market may open door for competitors - here’s how,"Feb 27, 2024, 17:26 IST","Paytm crisis: Paytm's impending exit from the employee benefits market due to regulatory actions against its payments bank and mobile wallet has paved the way for other players like Pluxee (formerly Sodexo), Zaggle, and banks to grow their presence in this sector.
ET quoted a senior fintech executive saying that large corporations are seeking alternative options for meal benefits due to the upcoming halt in services for Paytm Payments Bank and its wallet after March 15.

Zaggle, a listed startup, aims to onboard 100-150 new corporate clients by the end of the next financial year. In recent months, the company has already begun partnerships with notable entities such as IT company Wipro, staffing solutions provider Quess Corp, private sector lender Axis Bank, and more.
Raj Narayanam, Executive Chairman of Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, noted, “In the meal benefit space, we have seen a massive uptick in demand and given the situation with competition, we have made steady inroads by adding new clients.”

He did not reveal the specific companies that transitioned from Paytm to Zaggle after January 31 when the Reserve Bank of India announced restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank.
Zaggle collaborates with banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, and IndusInd Bank to provide prepaid payment services to its corporate clients. In addition to meal vouchers and employee benefits, Zaggle also offers companies a spending management tool.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the company recorded a net profit of Rs 24.8 crore on operational revenue of Rs 502 crore. Presently, its market capitalization stands at around Rs 4,200 crore.

Industry insiders told the financial daily that Pluxee, the employee benefit business recently hived off from Sodexo, is also aiming to capitalise on new opportunities arising from the developments at Paytm Payments Bank.
A Pluxee spokesperson stated that its food wallet business has been experiencing substantial year-on-year growth, pre-dating the Paytm issue. However, they declined to comment on any specific increase in business following January 31.
Queries sent via email to Paytm received no response.
Changing landscape of employee benefits
Disruptions in the employee benefits space have highlighted the significance of tax-free meal benefits under India's tax regulations. Many companies provide a portion of employees' salaries as tax-free benefits, loading the funds into prepaid wallets linked to cards for transactions. These cards are restricted to use at merchant outlets selling food and beverages.
Various players, including French majors like Sodexo and Edenred, along with fintech startups like Zeta, have been key players in this domain. However, recent shifts, including Edenred India relinquishing its licence and Zeta selling its meal benefit business to Sodexo, have reshaped the competitive landscape.
HDFC Bank provides Foodplus meal cards, and ICICI Bank offers its meal cards. Sodexo recently spun off its meal benefits business as Pluxee. In recent years, Paytm has become a dominant fintech player in this sector.
The fintech executive mentioned earlier stated, “Paytm with its superior wallet offering and acceptance across the country had managed to grab a large market share in this business and was second competing with Sodexo, but now the leader board is set to get disrupted; Zaggle is trying to grab that space.”
Paytm provided the option for corporations to create sub-wallets for various expenses such as food, fuel, and similar items. Leveraging the popularity of the app and its extensive network of merchants, employees found it convenient to access and use funds easily.

Employee benefits industry: Margins, market size and compliance
The employee benefit industry presents an attractive opportunity for payment players, although profit margins in this segment are notably slim. To generate profits in this sector, companies often require ancillary services to supplement revenue. For Paytm, this niche business represented a small fraction of its broader fintech offerings, aiding its penetration into enterprises. Zaggle provides comprehensive spend management solutions, while Sodexo maintains diversified business interests spanning facilities management.
According to industry estimates, the current market size of this industry is approximately Rs 1 lakh crore in disbursements, benefiting roughly 15-18 million consumers. Some large companies make significant disbursements annually.
An executive was quoted anonymously saying that one of the largest financial services companies in the country disburses around Rs 1,500 crore every year to its employees, primarily for meal benefits.
The most critical aspect of this business is ensuring proper KYC of the final user, who is the employee, and guaranteeing that the funds are used at the appropriate places.
Raj Narayanam of Zaggle mentioned that tracking very small value payments based on merchant codes becomes challenging when using QR code-based payments. However, compliance is better managed through prepaid cards.
A senior HR executive at a large corporation stated that moving forward, most large companies will choose to engage with multiple vendors to mitigate the risk of disruption.
This person further added that banks are also advocating for sincere KYC of the final user of the wallet and clear understanding of its usage.",Times Of India

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.

A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India
"Life for Russian political prisoners: 'Isolation, poor food & arbitrary punishment'","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:13 IST","Vladimir Kara-Murza could only laugh when officials in Penal Colony No. 6 inexplicably put a small cabinet in his already-cramped concrete cell, next to a fold-up cot, stool, sink and latrine. That moment of dark humour came because the only things he had to store in it were a toothbrush and a mug, said his wife, Yevgenia, since the opposition activist wasn't allowed any personal items in solitary confinement.

Another time, she said, Kara-Murza was told to collect his bedding from across the corridor - except that prisoners must keep their hands behind their backs whenever outside their cells. ""How was he supposed to pick it up? With his teeth?"" Yevgenia said. When he collected the sheets, a guard appeared and told him he violated the rules, bringing more discipline. Kara-Murza was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence for a Kremlin critic.
For political prisoners like Kara-Murza, life in Russia's penal colonies is a grim reality of physical and psychological pressure, sleep deprivation, insufficient food, health care that is poor or simply denied, and a dizzying set of arbitrary rules.
According to Memorial - a group founded to document repression, there are 680 political prisoners in Russia who are being held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's crackdown. This month brought the stunning news from a remote Arctic penal colony, one of Russia's harshest facilities: the still-unexplained death of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's fiercest foe.
Most often, inmates live in barracks tightly packed with bunk beds. Konstantin Kotov, an activist who spent over a year in Penal Colony No. 2 , recalls cramped quarters of 60 men per room. Meals are unsatisfying: Breakfast was porridge, lunch was soup with little or no meat, mashed potatoes and a meat or fish cutlet; as was dinner. Inmates got two eggs a week, and fruit and vegetables were a luxury. Reports of physical abuse are common for ordinary inmates but rare for political prisoners, advocates say. Instead, intimidation often comes via enforcing minor infractions. Navalny spent months in a punishment cell for not buttoning his uniform properly or not putting his hands behind his back. He once described it as a ""concrete kennel"" of 8-by-10-feet that, depending on the season, was ""cold and damp,"" or ""hot and there's almost no air"".

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.
Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam. The aspirants from rural areas are not likely to face difficulty as all facilities are available in every nook and corner,” says Pathak.
The Commission said that the name of the candidate and the date on which the photograph was taken must also be mentioned clearly on the photograph. The faces of the candidates should also occupy three-fourths of the space in the photograph, the official notification said.
The Commission has also asked the candidates to make sure that their appearance matches their photograph at each stage of the examination process – Preliminary, Mains (written) and Interview or Personality test. For instance, if a candidate uploads a bearded photograph, he must appear with the same look in the Preliminary, Mains (Written) and Interview/Personality Test. Same would be the case with spectacles, moustaches, etc.
Candidates who wish to apply for the Civil Service Examination=Preliminary 2024 for about 1,056 vacant posts, can visit the official website at upsc.gov.in and submit the application form. Candidates scoring above the cut-off marks in CSE prelims will become eligible to register for the main examination.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Focus is on offering solutions against selling the products: Dinesh K Khara, Chairman, State Bank of India","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:44:00 AM IST","Much-needed private investments to quicken the pace of economic expansion are just ‘around the corner’, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara tells Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan, pointing to aggregate capacity utilisation reaching thresholds that have historically prompted corporate boards to draw up expansion plans.

Mumbai-based SBI, which reported record profits topping Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal year, is the winner of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in the Company of the Year category. In an interview touching upon a wide range of topics, Khara tells ET that India’s focus on building manufacturing muscle would further strengthen the growth capex trend and, in turn, banks that are expected to help finance India's spectacular and exciting journey along the competitiveness gradient. Edited excerpts:


There are a couple of reasons — a part of it comes from the macro and some part of it from the contribution from all the SBIians. It's more like a citizenship of the bank. Since the macro was doing well in terms of the demand which was demonstrated during Covid and also the enabling ecosystem created by the government, it created a very positive environment for the bank. Covid was the first test of resilience of the banking system and of the State Bank of India. The other piece was the positivity in the organisation that helped us in getting the best out of everyone at SBI. And when they started tasting success, their confidence improved. Ensuring the timely delivery and keeping a very close eye in terms of the quality of the loan book helped us in generating interest income where we were not required to make any provisions.


During Covid there were not enough opportunities for lending. But at the same time there are enough deposits. We went for the rupee dollar swaps and we supported our international balance sheet. We got into supply chain financing activity in our overseas operation. When we could see the demand coming up in India, we unwound those rupee dollar swaps and brought the money back and supported the growth in the domestic economy.


During Covid there was a reasonable demand we saw for retail growth. We looked at opportunities and worked out what all solutions we can offer. So orientation was changed in terms of offering solutions as against selling the products. We were quite cognizant of the fact that recovery of the economy will depend upon the growth of the SMEs. So, we started investing in terms of the infrastructure for SME, and ensured that each of the zonal offices of the bank, which are more than 100 across the country, had a AGM level officer who was responsible for SME loans and brought the sanctioning committees nearer to the ground. We had taken up the task to scale up this SME business to around `4 lakh crore and I am happy to share that today we have already crossed the `4 lakh crore and much before the financial year 2023-24 target we had set. Our SME book has got perhaps one of the lowest gross NPA which is at 4.33%.


We looked at the opportunities available and ensured that we have adequate infrastructure in place to ensure that we underwrite a quality book and we should have effective follow up... We came out with the loan management system. Now we have brought in the business division in SME. We came out with the pre-approved business loans. So we did a lot of work in this space and that is the reason why we can now see a Rs 4 lakh crore book which is very strong in terms of quality.


Our agri book was also stagnating for many years at about Rs 2 lakh crore. At that point of time we said that we should take it to Rs 3 lakh crore and today we are almost at that number — Rs 2.92 lakh crore.

In terms of quality also, even in this book we used to have high gross NPA, now it has been brought into the single digit. In the SME space, we also took help from our large corporate relationships. We started mapping their vendor distributor ecosystem end to end so that they will have a very dependable supply chain and also at the same time we would have the visibility of the cash flows for these enterprises.


There are a couple of things which have taken place in the ecosystem and this is essentially coming from the credit bureaus, particularly in the retail segment. Credit bureaus have changed the trajectory because there is enough and the clear visibility in terms of the credit history of the borrower. In retail, one should have the system structure in place unless and until the structure is well oiled, there can be challenges in retail. So that is the reason why we invested well in the structure. All our retail loans we have got the loan management system which are end to end digital and also it leaves hardly any discussion on ground and they are all having the business rule in general embedded into it. So when the scale goes up, there has to be uniformity in the underwriting standards. That is the reason why in our retail book, the gross NPA is actually less than 0.70%.


When it comes to private capex, there are different stages. Normally, it comes to the drawing board when the capacity utilization reaches somewhere around 75%. If we look at some of the numbers in 2022-23, we have seen the capital commitment to the tune of Rs 37 lakh crore by the private corporates. Also in the first half it is around Rs 20 lakh crore. When it comes to the growth in numbers there is always a lag between corporate credit and capital commitment. Once people have got a clear visibility of the demand, they start evaluating the options relating to the capex. The undisbursed limits for the term loans have been released. So that's a very clear reflection that there is a definite departure as compared to the past. That gives us the confidence that the private capex is just around the corner.


All the initiatives which have been taken by the government in terms of the infrastructure creation has also created an enabling environment because eventually the road and rail infrastructure which is getting created will lead to a situation where the logistic cost is going to come down. They are aiming to bring it down by half to about 7% and I think they are much on course. There is a very clear focus of orienting this economy to become manufacturing oriented. That also is going to be one of the other factors leading to even more capex commitments also.


We are quite well placed at current levels at somewhere around 67-68%. The RBI is not prescribing any credit deposit ratio, but nevertheless, there has to be enough deposit base so that there is enough muscle in the banking system to lend. What I expect is banks will be even more careful, and choosy in terms of picking up the assets which they should support. So that is something that appears to be the potential outcome.


CASA before Covid used to be around 40% in the system, so, I would say that it is actually coming back to the same levels after going to around 44% during Covid because there were not enough opportunities for people to spend money. Now people are coming back to spending habits. That's one aspect. The second aspect is that invariably we have seen that during inflationary times, there is a tendency on the part of all savers to put their money in high interest earning assets class. It is a part of the cycle.


Banking system would be Rs 200 lakh crore, mutual fund industry would be about Rs 50 lakh crore, life insurance is about Rs 60 lakh crore. Pension fund is about Rs 10 lakh crore, and I think when it comes to the stock market, it would be about Rs 300 odd lakh crore. That is the broad composition. Even if youngsters are putting their money into SIP, they will route it through the banking system. That money in any case has to be channelised through the system only. There will be competition vis-a-vis the fixed deposit but it is the financial literacy which will perhaps eventually guide.


Competition is a reality which none of us can ignore and obviously when it comes to banking to strike a fine balance between the cost of deposit and the returns which they will generate. So the fact remains that if at all you want to maintain the excellent asset quality, you should be in a position to lend at the most competitive rates and for lending at the most competitive rates, you must be in a position to keep a check on your cost of resources. It is a very fine balance which people have to maintain because there are multiple stakeholders whose aspirations must be honored.


In the retail segment, growth was at a very high pace, at about 30% for many of the entities and that too in the very low ticket size. A little greater analysis revealed that much of it was being given based upon the spending patterns, whereas prudent lending principle suggests that it should be based upon the ability of people to repay, which means that their EMI to NMI (Net Monthly Income) ratio becomes very critical. That is the reason why perhaps RBI came down on the unsecured loans. Such entities were not having enough recovery mechanisms in place. RBI came down with such prescriptions to ensure that there should be orderly growth in the system and there should not be unhealthy growth.


Across the globe, the financial sector is very tightly regulated. The safety and security of the system is a function of the safety and security of all the players who are there in the ecosystem. FinTechs have a capability, they are very agile, they are in a position to offer solutions to a problem and to that extent, they actually create value for the system. As an entity, we are consuming the services of Fintech. But, yes of course, being a regulated entity, this is something which is on the top of our mind always, that anything which we do, it should be in line with what is the prescription from the regulator. Whereas as a part of DNA, they are more independent in terms of their thinking, in terms of offering solutions. It is for the mutual benefit for fintechs to understand and appreciate the ecosystem and the regulatory environment and for entities like banks to consume their services so that even banks become nimble. Fintechs can, you know, play second fiddle or substitute the bank's efforts rather than trying to be something on their own.


We have to stay ahead of the curve and for that we have to keep on investing in terms of understanding the evolving trends and how we should strengthen our risk management capabilities. Even in the good times, we are having a sharper focus on the risk management capability of the bank and we are investing well in terms of understanding the risk. We are having this sort of modelling for all kinds of risks. For the time being things look perfectly okay. We should have the mitigants in place. The fundamental principle is that the balance sheet should always remain strong",The economic times
CCI proposes changes to confidential info sharing,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 AM IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has proposed to amend the so-called ""confidentiality ring"" regime that governs the treatment of confidential information in its proceedings, seeking to streamline the processes and prevent any delays in disposal of cases.

The regime, introduced in 2022, allows parties involved in a case to have access to confidential information or documents relating to other parties in an investigation to better defend themselves, subject to riders.

The draft regulations released by the anti-trust regulator have set a time frame for seeking and granting access to confidential information.

The CCI has proposed that the party seeking access to confidential information must request for setting up a confidentiality ring at the earliest. If such a request is made by a party after the receipt of the non-confidential version of the investigation report, it will be made within seven days, with a provision to give another 7 days, subject to conditions. The regulator has sought stakeholder comments on the draft proposals until March 27.

Neelambera Sandeepan, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said the proposed amendments aim to ""prevent delays caused in enforcement proceedings on account of accessibility of confidential documents"". They also specify conditions and circumstances as to when the confidentiality rings can be set up, she said.

A party seeking confidentiality over the information or documents furnished by it will set out cogent reasons for such a treatment, the draft said. The party must specify the date on which such confidential treatment will expire on a self-certification basis, it said.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

A legal challenge would probably follow such an action, which would be in opposition to the long-standing interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

""A merit-based immigration system that protects American labour and promotes American values"" is what Trump has pledged to pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he suspended numerous work visas and implemented measures to restrict access to certain visa programs during his first time in office.",The economic times
States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.

However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a fiscal deficit target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.

The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

The states have so far drawn down 31.5 per cent more debt this fiscal at Rs 8.143 lakh crore as against Rs 6.193 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:57:00 AM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.


“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:


US markets

The Dow led Wall Street lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

At 09:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.05 points, or 0.26%, at 38,967.18, the S&P 500 was down 2.79 points, or 0.06%, at 5,066.74, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.59 points, or 0.05%, at 15,967.67.

European Markets

European shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in basic resources stocks and a string of upbeat earnings, while investors and central bankers braced for inflation data this week that could alter the course for interest rates.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ticked up 0.1% by 9:35 GMT, while Germany's benchmark DAX climbed 0.4%, logging another record high.

Investors are taking a pause after last week's surge in artificial intelligence-driven buying which propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high.

Tech View

In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.

Most active stocks in terms of turnover

CMS Infosystems (Rs 1,684 crore), ICICI Lombard General Insurance (Rs 1,179 crore), Vodafone Idea (Rs 187 crore), IREDA (Rs 174 crore) were among the most active stocks on BSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.

Most active stocks in volume terms

Vodafone Idea (Traded shares: 11.45 crore), CMS Infosystems (Traded shares: 6.51 crore) YES Bank (Traded shares: 4.26 crore), GTL Infra (Traded shares: 6 crore), IREDA (Traded shares: 1.12 crore), Easy Trip Planners (Traded shares: 93 lakh), NHPC (Traded shares: 76 lakh), IRFC (Traded shares: 75.45 lakh), were among those most actively traded in volume terms on BSE.

Stocks showing buying interest

Shares of Railtel Corporation, BEML, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services, Intellect Design Arena, Jamna Auto, KNR Construction and BSE were among the stocks that witnessed strong buying interest from market participants.

52 Week Highs

Over 300 stocks hit their 52-week highs on Tuesday while 20 stocks slipped to their 52-week lows. Among the ones which hit their 52-week highs included Adani Green, Bharat Electronics, CAMS, CIPLA, Data Patterns, DLF, Havells, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Inox Wind, Intellect Design and Power Grid Corporation.

Stocks seeing selling pressure

Among the largecap names were Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Finance, State Bank of India (SBI), Bajaj Finserv and Divi's Laboratories. Other stocks which witnessed significant selling pressure were Vodafone Idea, FDC, Godawari Power, Adani Energy Solutions and Shriram Finance.

Sentiment meter favours bulls

While action in heavyweights like TCS, Tata Motors, Larsen & Toubro and Bharti Airtel helped markets reverse their morning losses, the overall breadth in the market was tilted in favour of bears. Out of the 3,929 stocks that traded on the BSE on Tuesday, 1,493 stocks witnessed advances, 2,353 saw declines while 83 stocks remained unchanged.

Ruling BJP kills two birds with one stone in Uttar Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:49:00 AM IST","Lucknow: BJP's strategy to bring SP MLAs to its side and garner the magic number for the victory of its eighth Rajya Sabha candidate also conceals a well-thought-out plan of strengthening itself in some weak Lok Sabha seats to which some MLAs belong, while giving a jolt to Samajwadi Party's morale ahead of the general elections.

At least seven SP MLAs are suspected to have cross-voted for BJP's candidates on Tuesday. The spadework for Tuesday likely began at least a fortnight ago, after which, assured of extra support, Sanjay Seth was brought in as the surprise eighth candidate by BJP. The party needed eight extra votes for Seth's win. Alarm bells first rang when eight SP MLAs skipped the dinner hosted by chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday and remained unreachable. On Tuesday morning, the first blow was dealt by SP MLA from Unchahar, Raebareli, Manoj Pandey, who resigned from the post of chief whip of the party before the voting commenced. Later, these MLAs were seen posing with deputy CM Brajesh Pathak confirming all doubts. Akhilesh Yadav declared that all who have cross-voted will be ousted from the party.

Observers say BJP has achieved two objectives. Not only will this deal a blow to SP, some MLAs, who have cross-voted and will likely be seen in BJP in the coming days, represent parts of Lok Sabha seats which BJP views as a challenge like Raebareli and Ambedkarnagar.

Apart from Raebareli Sadar assembly seat which is represented by BJP's Aditi Singh, all the remaining four assembly seats of the Raebareli LS constituency are occupied by SP, in what could have made it an uphill battle for BJP, coupled with the fact that it is a Congress bastion. Pandey's switchover, considering his credentials as a strong Brahmin face, will provide a significant boost to the party's prospects there and he may even be fielded as the BJP candidate from the seat, as is being speculated.

Top BJP leaders head to Bihar as Lok Sabha polls draw near,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:33:00 AM IST","New Delhi: Within a fortnight beginning Wednesday, BJP's top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, will address public meetings in Bihar as part of BJP-led NDA's aim to win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The coalition, which won 39 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming for a clean sweep bolstered by JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar's return.

On March 2, Modi will address two public meetings in Aurangabad and Begusarai. This will be his first visit to Bihar after Kumar switched sides and rejoined NDA. Modi and Kumar will share the stage in Aurangabad after a long time.

Singh will visit Bihar on Wednesday. He will visit Sitamarhi and Darbhanga to address meetings. On Thursday, Shah will review poll preparedness and address a meeting of party workers near Patna.

The opposition camp too is planning a show of strength with a joint rally in Patna on March 3 in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to participate. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been touring the state as part of his Jan Vishwas Yatra, which will conclude on February 29.

"Shami undergoes ankle surgery, set to miss IPL","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:31:00 AM IST","Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami has undergone a successful surgery on his left achilles tendon, which rules him out of next month's Indian Premier League and possibly the T20 World Cup in June. The 33-year-old, who last played for India in the ODI World Cup final against Australia on November 19, went under the knife in London on Monday.

Shami, who is eager to ""get back on my feet soon"" stares at a recovery time of a minimum of three months.

He will thus miss the IPL slated to be played from March 22 to May 26, as reported by PTI last week.

Shami is also a doubtful starter for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.

""Just had a successful heel operation on my achilles tendon! Recovery is going to take some time, but looking forward to getting back on my feet,"" Shami tweeted, along with several pictures of him in the hospital, on X on Monday.

— MdShami11 (@MdShami11)

Shami, who was one of the architects of India's stupendous ODI World Cup campaign with 24 wickets, had played through pain as he had problems with his landing but didn't let it affect his performance.

He had flown to London in January to take special ankle injections. However, the medication didn't work and the fast bowler had to opt for surgery.

The absence of Shami is a major blow for Gujarat Titans, who have also traded all-rounder Hardik Pandya to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash deal. Shami was the side's highest wicket-taker during their runner-up finish in IPL last year.

Shami, who was recently conferred with the Arjuna Award, has 229 Test, 195 ODI and 24 T20 wickets in his decade-long career.

The development raises a question mark about the injury rehabilitation management programme planned by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for Shami.

It is also highly unlikely that the pacer would be able to make a comeback before India's Test matches at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand (October November).

His target could be the marquee away series against Australia.

Army called in amid fresh tension in Manipur; Assam Rifles deployed after senior cop abducted briefly,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:25:00 AM IST","The Army was called in as fresh tension mounted in Manipur on Tuesday and four columns of the Assam Rifles were deployed in Imphal East after a senior police officer was abducted allegedly by cadres of the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation, from his residence, officials said. The officer, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumar, posted in the operations wing of the Manipur Police, was rescued after a swift action by police and security forces, the officials said.

The officer has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

Giving details of the incident that took place around 7 pm on Tuesday, the officials said that a group of cadres owing allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol attacked the house of Kumar at Wangkhei in Imphal East.

The reason for this indiscriminate firing was that the officer concerned had arrested six members of the group for their alleged involvement in vehicle theft, the officials said.

Following the arrests, a group of Meira Paibis (Meitei women group) had protested and blocked roads demanding their release.

In the Tuesday evening attack, armed cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol ransacked the house and damaged at least four vehicles with gunfire, they said.

Detailing the chaotic events, M Kulla, the police officer's father, explained, ""We tried to talk to the armed men after they entered, but all of a sudden they started firing at the vehicles and properties. So we had to rush inside and lock ourselves.""

The father, according to the officials, called his son and informed about the incident.

The officer rushed with his team only to be abducted as they were outnumbered by the cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol.

The Manipur Police acted promptly, mobilising forces to launch a successful rescue operation, ensuring Kumar's safe return within hours.

The state government had to take help of the Army as the situation worded after the rescue efforts.

Officials said that four columns of the Assam Rifles were requisitioned and deployed around the area where the incident took place. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is not applicable in valley areas.

The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, functions under the operational command of the Army.

The region has witnessed escalating violence since May 3, with over 180 casualties reported after a ""Tribal Solidarity March"" in the hill districts protested the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

The Meiteis, constituting around 53 per cent of Manipur's population and residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, contrast the tribals, including Nagas and Kukis, who make up 40 per cent and primarily inhabit the hill districts.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. runs McDonald's in western India and South India. operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.",The economic times
NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

BJP wins eight Rajya Sabha seats; SP bags two seats in UP,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:04:00 PM IST","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday won eight, out of ten, Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, SP bagged two seats in the state.

Voting in the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh began around 9 am on Tuesday. The BJP had fielded eight candidates and the Samajwadi Party (SP) three.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

"Rajya Sabha Elections: ""CRPF, Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 Congress MLAs,"" Himachal CM Sukhvinder Sukhu","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:37:00 PM IST","As counting for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh is underway, state Chief Minister Sukhvinder Sukhu on Tuesday alleged that CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away five to six Congress MLAs and urged the Himachal BJP leaders to have patience and not to threaten polling officers.

""The manner in which the counting has begun and Opposition leaders are threatening the polling officers again and again is not right for democracy...They had halted the counting for long. I urge the Himachal BJP unit leaders to have patience, don't put pressure on people...CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 MLAs,"" CM Sukhu told reporters on Tuesday.

He further said that, ""I can say that the people who have gone away are being contacted by their families, I urge them to contact their families...There is no need to worry.""

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

"Rajya Sabha Polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP bags one in Karnataka","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:24:00 PM IST","In a closely contested electoral battle in Karnataka, all three Congress candidates emerged victorious. The three candidates- Ajay Maken, Dr. Syed Naseer Hussain, and GC Chandrashekhar- secured wins with slender margins, receiving 47, 46, and 46 votes respectively.

Voting in the elections for the four Rajya Sabha seats in Karnataka began Tuesday at 9 am. The counting began at 5pm.

The Congress had 133 MLAs, the BJP has 66, JD (S) 19, while others account for four.

Of the four others, the Congress claimed the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and was confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.

The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members - Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP and G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah from the Congress.

The Congress, which was confident of winning three seats had fielded G C Chandrashekhar, Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken.

The BJP had fielded Narayansa Bhandage as also JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy as the NDA candidate which had made the election interesting.

Congress sources claimed that the party has the support of four others, reported PTI.

""Besides, we may get three votes from the rival camp,"" a top Congress source told PTI.

Fearing cross-voting, the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance huddled their MLAs in a private resort on Monday.

They also conducted a workshop for the new members to inform them about the election process and how to cast their votes.

All parties have issued whips to the MLAs, who are the voters in Tuesday's poll, amid apprehensions of cross-voting.

According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, the preference votes kick in.

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan
What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

The step was taken in order to develop the onshore rupee non-deliverable derivatives contract market and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently plan their hedging activities, the RBI said.

Such transactions would be cash-settled in rupees and shall have the flexibility of cash settlement between two relevant banks and between a bank and a person residing outside India in rupees or any foreign currency.",The economic times
Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times

Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru."" The biggest challenge, he pointed out, for such projects specially in metros like Delhi, is land acquisition, said Bhagat.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

SC to Centre: Take call on standard hospital charges or we may slap CGHS rates,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:05 IST","NEW DELHI: A cataract surgery could cost up to Rs 10,000 per eye in a govt hospital and Rs 30,000-1,40,000 in a private facility. Supreme Court Tuesday took strong exception to this disparity and inability of the Centre to implement a 14-year-old law-Clinical Establishment (Central Government) Rules-mandating notification of a standard rate in consultation with states for treatment and procedures of ailments in metros, cities and towns.

Govt told SC though it had repeatedly written to states on this, they didn't respond. SC said citizens have a fundamental right to healthcare and the Centre can't shirk its responsibility on this ground.

It asked Union health secretary to call a meeting of his state counterparts to ensure notification of a standard rate within a month. ""If Union govt fails to find a solution, then we will consider petitioner's plea for implementing CGHS-prescribed standardised rates,"" SC warned.

'Use central laws if states don't fix uniform hospital charges'
A PIL by NGO 'Veterans Forum for Transparency in Public Life' through advocate Danish Zubair Khan had sought a direction to Centre to determine rate of fee chargeable from patients in terms of Rule 9 of Clinical Establishment (Central Govt) Rules, 2012.
Under the Rules, all hospitals and clinical establishments, to keep intact their registration, must ""display rates charged for each type of service provided and facilities available for benefit of patients at a conspicuous place in vernacular as well as in English language; and charge rates for each type of procedures and services within range of rates determined and issued by Centre from time to time, in consultation with state govts.""


Petitioner told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta that Centre acted promptly in notifying standardised rates for treatment of patients during Covid and that if states did not cooperate in framing range of rates for treatment of ailments, it could use powers under central laws to unilaterally notify fees to be charged for different procedures.

"Elon Musk raises his Microsoft 'customer care' complaint directly to Satya Nadella, here's what he said","Feb 27, 2024, 16:23 IST","Clearly the text didn’t seem to have worked. Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

As per the rule, where two or more candidates get same value of votes for a lone RS seat, the candidate with the lowest number of original votes, where this number is same for all, is to be excluded by a draw of lots.
""The RO puts slips with names of the candidates in a box, which is shaken before the slips are drawn. The candidate whose slip is drawn is eliminated/excluded, and whose slip remains in the box is declared winner,"" an EC functionary explained. ""It is written in the stars and written by God. In a normal draw of lots, the name taken out wins. Under strange rule of EC the name taken out of the box, which was mine, loses... is excluded,"" Singhvi later said at a press conference.

Rajya Sabha polls: Cross-voting by SP MLAs gives BJP stunning UP win,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:41 IST","LUCKNOW: BJP registered a stunning win in Rajya Sabha polls in UP, winning eight of 10 seats, amid cross-voting by at least seven SP MLAs. Lone BSP MLA, Uma Shankar Singh, too, voted in favour of BJP candidates - a sharp departure from the past when the Mayawati-led outfit preferred to abstain from voting.
The development was perceived as a blow to INDIA bloc, which has been positioning itself as a potent rival of BJP in LS polls due soon.

Wife jumps to death after husband dies by heart attack at Delhi zoo,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:44 IST","NEW DELHI: Friends from college who got married last Nov, Abhishek and Anjali - both in their 20s - died within hours of each other at the same hospital as tragedy befell the couple just when they had set out to make memories.
Feb 26 was special - the day they had decided to be together. This Monday, they marked the day as 'Mr & Mrs' for the first time with an outing to Delhi zoo.

Abhishek, 25, who worked with a Delhi-based NGO, had a heart attack and slumped to the ground in pain as they walked around the zoo. By late evening, Abhishek was declared dead by doctors.
Unable to bear the loss, Anjali, 23, jumped from the balcony of the couple's 7th-floor condominium in Vaishali, soon after the body of her husband was brought home.

Cops probe why man not taken to hospital close to Delhi zoo
Earlier, at the zoo, a relative had responded to Anjali's SOS and called an ambulance which took him to GTB hospital.
When Abhishek's condition didn't improve, doctors referred him to Safdarjung hospital. ""At the hospital, his wife Anjali fainted in the evening and was persuaded by her relatives to return home,"" a Ghaziabad police officer told TOI on Tuesday.


An hour after she had left, Abhishek passed away. ""The body reached home around 9.30pm on Monday. Anjali would not stop crying and locked herself in her room,"" ACP Swatantra Singh said.
Minutes later, guards at the society heard a scream and a thud. Anjali had jumped from the balcony of their apartment, which the couple shared with Abhishek's parents. ""She was still breathing when a police team reached her. She died during treatment around 8am on Tuesday,"" the ACP said.
Anjali was initially taken to a nearby private hospital and from there to Safdarjung, the same place where Abhishek had died hours earlier.
""Preliminary investigation revealed the couple had gone to Delhi zoo and wanted to spend the whole day there. All of a sudden, the husband complained of a pinching pain in the chest and collapsed,"" said a source.

A relative said the two had been in a relationship for several years and it had taken them several months to convince their parents about the marriage. ""I don't know how Abhishek suffered a heart attack at such a young age. He was a fitness freak - he played multiple sports and would hit the gym regularly,"" the relative said, adding, ""When they went out on Monday, they had said they would have lunch and dinner outside and get back late.""
Police said they were talking to relatives to find out why Abhishek was taken to GTB hospital - which is an hour away from Delhi zoo - when there are other hospitals nearby.
Doctors said the ""golden hour"" is crucial for patients who suffer a heart attack. ""Youngsters should assess their risk factors regularly and get health checks done. People with a family history of diabetes, heart ailments or hypertension are also prone to such risks. It is in the interest of everyone that people are trained in giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which will help in saving more lives,"" said Dr Vivek Tandon, additional director (interventional cardiology) at Fortis Hospital.

9-judge bench to rule on multi-cr query: Can states tax mineral-rich land?,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:39 IST","NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of Supreme Court led by CJI Chandrachud on Tuesday commenced hearing a contentious 25-year-old question related to federalism, the determination of which could impact thousands of crores of rupees in tax revenue for mineral-rich states, such as Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra, Assam, Chhattisgarh, MP and north-eastern region.

Eighty-five petitions have piled up before the bench with a common query: Do states have power to levy tax on mineral-producing land irrespective of provisions of Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act?
Parliament can limit but can't denude our taxing power, argue states
One of the main questions referred for adjudication by a nine-judge SC bench is: ""Can a state legislature, while levying a tax on land under List II Entry 49 of Seventh Schedule of Constitution, adopt a measure of tax based on value of produce of land? If yes, then would the constitutional position be any different insofar as the tax on land is imposed on mining land on account of List II Entry 50 and its interrelation with List I Entry 54?""
Criticality of the issue for mineral-rich states is evident from the fact that between 1993 and 2023, Jharkhand alone earned Rs 10,558 crore from tax on mineral bearing land. If SC decides against the states, Jharkhand will lose around Rs 350 crore a year in tax revenue.
Opening arguments for Jharkhand & Odisha in support of states' right to levy tax on mineral-bearing land, advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said, ""Since royalty is a consideration in lieu of grant of mineral rights, the tax will be of nature contemplated in List II Entry 50. This taxing power is exclusively within domain of state legislature and cannot be imposed by Parliament by law. List I Entry 54, being a non-taxing entry, does not include any power to impose any tax. It is a regulatory entry."" He said, ""Parliament by exercising power under List I Entry 54 can impose limitations on state's power to tax mineral rights, but cannot usurp or arrogate the said taxing power to itself and denude state of its taxing power.""

Dwivedi said liability to pay royalty arises only upon a grant of mining lease, which transfers right to carry out mining activities in leased area to the lessee. He clarified that no mining could be carried out without such grant of lease and said such a liability could not be understood as a 'tax' within meaning of Article 366(28).
Arguments will continue on Wednesday.

Gaganyaan: Why test pilots are best suited for first mission,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:26 IST","BENGALURU: Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Gaganyaan — India’s first human spaceflight mission — on August 15, 2018, speculation was rife about who the potential astronauts could be and civilians, including women, had not been ruled out.
Although Isro was initially looking at all probable candidates for the first mission, TOI, within months of the PM’s announcement, learnt and reported that all astronauts that will be part of the first crewed mission would be test pilots from the Indian Air Force (IAF), something both Isro and IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) which was responsible for the selection confirmed later.

Meet India's four astronauts selected for ISRO's Gaganyaan Mission

“It’s quite straightforward because space technology is essentially an extension of aviation. And test pilots, by virtue of their specialisations, have always been called upon to study deeply all that can probably go wrong in something that has not been tried before,” Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut, had told TOI earlier.

“...That gives them the edge as they are experienced in preparing themselves better. Also, in case things do not go as per planned, their specialisation and experience kicks-in and helps them analyse the situation. This makes them the natural choice,” he added.
Former IAF test pilot Wing Commander KT Sebastian had said that most pilots start test-flying when they are about 28 years old. “They are both physiologically and psychologically trained to adapt to situations that a space flight demands. Having flown different types of aircraft, they are quick to acquaint themselves with new systems. They are also accustomed to various types of pressures and operating against gravity because all test pilots other than those testing choppers, are from the fighter stream,” Sebastian had said.

Others that TOI spoke with said test pilots were best suited to also diagnose failures quickly and execute commands from control stations.
Globally too a majority of all astronauts have been test pilots. Therefore, it wasn’t a surprise when India selected four test pilots — Group Captains Prashanth Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Prathap and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla, who were bestowed with astronaut wings by PM Modi on Tuesday — were selected.
The four men, who have completed the first semester of their India module at the astronaut training centre in Bengaluru after they finished their initial training in Russia are under continuous training, will continue their mission-specific crew training.

"State units agree with Rohit Sharma's 'hunger' comment, say BCCI Ranji diktat is potential saviour","Feb 27, 2024, 17:57 IST","NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma emphasised the importance of Test opportunities being reserved for players displaying a genuine hunger for the format. This sentiment resonated with state associations grappling with young talents eager to make a mark in white-ball cricket but hesitant to invest in the grind of first-class games.
The ongoing debate between club and country has been fueled by the emergence of the IPL, and Rohit's firm stance on the matter coincided with established players like Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan ignoring a BCCI directive to participate in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, choosing instead to concentrate on their IPL preparations.


""Jin logon ko bhookh hai, hum unhi logon ko mauka denge (We will give opportunities to only those who are hungry),"" Rohit declared on Monday after a series-clinching win over England in the fourth Test in Ranchi.

""Agar hunger nahi hai to unko khila ke koi matlab nahi hai (There's no point in playing those who don't have the hunger),"" he said.
The hunger that Rohit emphasised was evident in emerging talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep, and the more established Shubman Gill, all of whom showcased their skills at different points in the series against England.
However, Rohit underscored the issue regarding unnamed individuals who appear to lack that passionate drive and determination.

""I concur with the Indian captain. There should be hunger in younger cricketers to play the longest format,"" Abhilash Khandekar, president of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association, told PTI.
It is for those that the BCCI issued a directive earlier this month asking centrally-contracted cricketers to be available for Ranji engagements.
Several representatives from state associations admitted that Rohit was not off the mark when he said those who are not up for it should not be considered for the toughest format. But they also feel that a system needs to be in place so that such a situation never arises.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

""Ranji Trophy cannot be taken lightly by any player, it is the backbone of Indian cricket. It is the most important tournament in domestic cricket. This should be followed up in other formats in domestic cricket,"" Khandekar said.
Another official, who did not wish to be named, went to the extent of saying that Ranji Trophy ran the risk of ""a slow death if it was not made mandatory for top players to compete.""
State units see the parent body's move as a case of better late than never.
""I complement BCCI for this decision of compelling players to play for their state in Ranji Trophy. I see it as a case of better late than never, this is going to help domestic cricket in a big way,"" said Khandekar.
In the recent past, the Indian batters have been found vulnerable on turning tracks at home.
Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar believes if elite players turn up for their respective states in Ranji Trophy whenever available, it would only make them better players of spin.
""Playing Ranji is very important. It helps you play spin better on Indian wickets, your overall skills are improved. And when you play foreign teams, it becomes easier (to face spin),"" said Vengsarkar, himself a great player of spin.
""I feel it is a player's wish whether to play Ranji or not. If he doesn't want to play, we have enough in India to choose from, they will play and establish themselves. No one is bigger than the game. No one is indispensable,"" he said.
In Kishan's absence from the ongoing series, Dhruv Jurel made the most of the opportunity by coming up with two brilliant under-pressure knocks in only his second Test.
Like the MPCA chief, a state unit official proposed another step to rein in players who ignore red-ball cricket.
""This was a much needed step and should have been taken earlier. If an India player is regularly featuring in Ranji Trophy, it acts a massive motivator to the younger players in the squad.
""I would also want the BCCI to empower state units to ban those players who don't play Ranji Trophy. If a senior is dropped for once, the juniors would not dare to ignore their red ball commitments for T20 cricket,"" said a state unit official requesting anonymity.

Each Rajya Sabha candidate needed at least 45 votes in the 224-MLA Karnataka Assembly to win a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. With 135 MLAs, the Congress had the exact number to elect its three candidates.
The BJP has 66 MLAs, which secured a comfortable win for party worker Narayansa Bhandage.
The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members -- Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar (BJP) and Congress's G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah.

Two BJP MLAs cross-vote
In a setback to the BJP-JD(S) alliance, saffron party MLA S T Somashekar voted for Maken while MLA Arbail Shivaram Hebbar abstained from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections for the four seats in Karnataka on Tuesday.
Somashekar represents Yashwantpur assembly constituency and Hebbar the Yellapur segment.
Leader of Opposition R Ashoka said they would seek action against Somashekhar, and termed the MLA's decision ""political suicide"".
Soon after voting, Somashekar told reporters that he voted as per his conscience. ""I went by my conscience and voted for those who worked for building schools and carry out development works in my constituency,"" the rebel BJP leader said.
Ashoka said Hebbar had been in touch with him since morning and assured him that he would vote for the BJP candidate.
""Hebbar had been telling me that he would not betray the party, but I don't know why he did not turn up to vote. He double-crossed us today, which he should not have done. We will initiate action against him,"" Ashoka said.
Both the MLAs had defected from Congress to the BJP along with 15 others, bringing down the 14-month-old coalition government of the Congress and the JD(S) in 2019 facilitating the installation of the BJP government.
In 2023, they once again got elected to the assembly on the BJP ticket.

Won't allow child marriage as long as I'm alive: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11 IST","GUWAHATI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in the assembly on Monday that he will not allow any child marriage in the state as long as he is alive.
""I want to make it loud and clear that till the time I am there, I will not allow you (Opposition) to play with the future of innocent Muslim children. I will bring an end to this exploitative business and will not allow a single child marriage to take place in Assam.""
He added, ""We will completely close the shop that you people have opened to ruin the daughters of the Muslim community by 2026.""

A IUDF MLA Karim Uddin Barbhuiya pleaded with speaker Biswajit Daimary to allow the adjournment motion on the decision to repeal the “Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act”. However, the speaker rejected it saying the matter is yet to be brought in the House.
This was also supported by Congress members of the House. Leader of the Opposition in the assembly and senior Congress leader, Debabrata Saikia, said the House should have been informed before taking any cabinet decision at a time when a session is undergoing. Responding to this, CM Sarma said, “We have not done anything outside the rule.
The rule is that a bill is first approved in the cabinet and then introduced in the House. We want to repeal the Act because it has provision of child marriage. A cabinet decision has been taken. The bill is yet to be introduced in the House.” Following this, the Congress MLAs walked out of the assembly, while the AIUDF MLAs staged a sit-in before the speaker.

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.
Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.
A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India
"Life for Russian political prisoners: 'Isolation, poor food & arbitrary punishment'","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:13 IST","Vladimir Kara-Murza could only laugh when officials in Penal Colony No. 6 inexplicably put a small cabinet in his already-cramped concrete cell, next to a fold-up cot, stool, sink and latrine. That moment of dark humour came because the only things he had to store in it were a toothbrush and a mug, said his wife, Yevgenia, since the opposition activist wasn't allowed any personal items in solitary confinement.

Another time, she said, Kara-Murza was told to collect his bedding from across the corridor - except that prisoners must keep their hands behind their backs whenever outside their cells. ""How was he supposed to pick it up? With his teeth?"" Yevgenia said. When he collected the sheets, a guard appeared and told him he violated the rules, bringing more discipline. Kara-Murza was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence for a Kremlin critic.
For political prisoners like Kara-Murza, life in Russia's penal colonies is a grim reality of physical and psychological pressure, sleep deprivation, insufficient food, health care that is poor or simply denied, and a dizzying set of arbitrary rules.
According to Memorial - a group founded to document repression, there are 680 political prisoners in Russia who are being held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's crackdown. This month brought the stunning news from a remote Arctic penal colony, one of Russia's harshest facilities: the still-unexplained death of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's fiercest foe.

Most often, inmates live in barracks tightly packed with bunk beds. Konstantin Kotov, an activist who spent over a year in Penal Colony No. 2 , recalls cramped quarters of 60 men per room. Meals are unsatisfying: Breakfast was porridge, lunch was soup with little or no meat, mashed potatoes and a meat or fish cutlet; as was dinner. Inmates got two eggs a week, and fruit and vegetables were a luxury. Reports of physical abuse are common for ordinary inmates but rare for political prisoners, advocates say. Instead, intimidation often comes via enforcing minor infractions. Navalny spent months in a punishment cell for not buttoning his uniform properly or not putting his hands behind his back. He once described it as a ""concrete kennel"" of 8-by-10-feet that, depending on the season, was ""cold and damp,"" or ""hot and there's almost no air"".

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.
Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam. The aspirants from rural areas are not likely to face difficulty as all facilities are available in every nook and corner,” says Pathak.
The Commission said that the name of the candidate and the date on which the photograph was taken must also be mentioned clearly on the photograph. The faces of the candidates should also occupy three-fourths of the space in the photograph, the official notification said.
The Commission has also asked the candidates to make sure that their appearance matches their photograph at each stage of the examination process – Preliminary, Mains (written) and Interview or Personality test. For instance, if a candidate uploads a bearded photograph, he must appear with the same look in the Preliminary, Mains (Written) and Interview/Personality Test. Same would be the case with spectacles, moustaches, etc.
Candidates who wish to apply for the Civil Service Examination=Preliminary 2024 for about 1,056 vacant posts, can visit the official website at upsc.gov.in and submit the application form. Candidates scoring above the cut-off marks in CSE prelims will become eligible to register for the main examination. The mains will be descriptive and will be conducted from September 20 for five days.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Focus is on offering solutions against selling the products: Dinesh K Khara, Chairman, State Bank of India","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:44:00 AM IST","Much-needed private investments to quicken the pace of economic expansion are just ‘around the corner’, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara tells Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan, pointing to aggregate capacity utilisation reaching thresholds that have historically prompted corporate boards to draw up expansion plans.

Mumbai-based SBI, which reported record profits topping Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal year, is the winner of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in the Company of the Year category. In an interview touching upon a wide range of topics, Khara tells ET that India’s focus on building manufacturing muscle would further strengthen the growth capex trend and, in turn, banks that are expected to help finance India's spectacular and exciting journey along the competitiveness gradient. Edited excerpts:


There are a couple of reasons — a part of it comes from the macro and some part of it from the contribution from all the SBIians. It's more like a citizenship of the bank. Since the macro was doing well in terms of the demand which was demonstrated during Covid and also the enabling ecosystem created by the government, it created a very positive environment for the bank. Covid was the first test of resilience of the banking system and of the State Bank of India. The other piece was the positivity in the organisation that helped us in getting the best out of everyone at SBI. And when they started tasting success, their confidence improved. Ensuring the timely delivery and keeping a very close eye in terms of the quality of the loan book helped us in generating interest income where we were not required to make any provisions.


During Covid there were not enough opportunities for lending. But at the same time there are enough deposits. We went for the rupee dollar swaps and we supported our international balance sheet. We got into supply chain financing activity in our overseas operation. When we could see the demand coming up in India, we unwound those rupee dollar swaps and brought the money back and supported the growth in the domestic economy.


During Covid there was a reasonable demand we saw for retail growth. We looked at opportunities and worked out what all solutions we can offer. So orientation was changed in terms of offering solutions as against selling the products. We were quite cognizant of the fact that recovery of the economy will depend upon the growth of the SMEs. So, we started investing in terms of the infrastructure for SME, and ensured that each of the zonal offices of the bank, which are more than 100 across the country, had a AGM level officer who was responsible for SME loans and brought the sanctioning committees nearer to the ground. We had taken up the task to scale up this SME business to around `4 lakh crore and I am happy to share that today we have already crossed the `4 lakh crore and much before the financial year 2023-24 target we had set. Our SME book has got perhaps one of the lowest gross NPA which is at 4.33%.


We looked at the opportunities available and ensured that we have adequate infrastructure in place to ensure that we underwrite a quality book and we should have effective follow up... We came out with the loan management system. Now we have brought in the business division in SME. We came out with the pre-approved business loans. So we did a lot of work in this space and that is the reason why we can now see a Rs 4 lakh crore book which is very strong in terms of quality.


Our agri book was also stagnating for many years at about Rs 2 lakh crore. At that point of time we said that we should take it to Rs 3 lakh crore and today we are almost at that number — Rs 2.92 lakh crore.

In terms of quality also, even in this book we used to have high gross NPA, now it has been brought into the single digit. In the SME space, we also took help from our large corporate relationships. We started mapping their vendor distributor ecosystem end to end so that they will have a very dependable supply chain and also at the same time we would have the visibility of the cash flows for these enterprises.


There are a couple of things which have taken place in the ecosystem and this is essentially coming from the credit bureaus, particularly in the retail segment. Credit bureaus have changed the trajectory because there is enough and the clear visibility in terms of the credit history of the borrower. In retail, one should have the system structure in place unless and until the structure is well oiled, there can be challenges in retail. So that is the reason why we invested well in the structure. All our retail loans we have got the loan management system which are end to end digital and also it leaves hardly any discussion on ground and they are all having the business rule in general embedded into it. So when the scale goes up, there has to be uniformity in the underwriting standards. That is the reason why in our retail book, the gross NPA is actually less than 0.70%.


When it comes to private capex, there are different stages. Normally, it comes to the drawing board when the capacity utilization reaches somewhere around 75%. If we look at some of the numbers in 2022-23, we have seen the capital commitment to the tune of Rs 37 lakh crore by the private corporates. Also in the first half it is around Rs 20 lakh crore. When it comes to the growth in numbers there is always a lag between corporate credit and capital commitment. Once people have got a clear visibility of the demand, they start evaluating the options relating to the capex. The undisbursed limits for the term loans have been released. So that's a very clear reflection that there is a definite departure as compared to the past. That gives us the confidence that the private capex is just around the corner.


All the initiatives which have been taken by the government in terms of the infrastructure creation has also created an enabling environment because eventually the road and rail infrastructure which is getting created will lead to a situation where the logistic cost is going to come down. They are aiming to bring it down by half to about 7% and I think they are much on course. There is a very clear focus of orienting this economy to become manufacturing oriented. That also is going to be one of the other factors leading to even more capex commitments also.


We are quite well placed at current levels at somewhere around 67-68%. The RBI is not prescribing any credit deposit ratio, but nevertheless, there has to be enough deposit base so that there is enough muscle in the banking system to lend. What I expect is banks will be even more careful, and choosy in terms of picking up the assets which they should support. So that is something that appears to be the potential outcome.


CASA before Covid used to be around 40% in the system, so, I would say that it is actually coming back to the same levels after going to around 44% during Covid because there were not enough opportunities for people to spend money. Now people are coming back to spending habits. That's one aspect. The second aspect is that invariably we have seen that during inflationary times, there is a tendency on the part of all savers to put their money in high interest earning assets class. It is a part of the cycle.


Banking system would be Rs 200 lakh crore, mutual fund industry would be about Rs 50 lakh crore, life insurance is about Rs 60 lakh crore. Pension fund is about Rs 10 lakh crore, and I think when it comes to the stock market, it would be about Rs 300 odd lakh crore. That is the broad composition. Even if youngsters are putting their money into SIP, they will route it through the banking system. That money in any case has to be channelised through the system only. There will be competition vis-a-vis the fixed deposit but it is the financial literacy which will perhaps eventually guide.


Competition is a reality which none of us can ignore and obviously when it comes to banking to strike a fine balance between the cost of deposit and the returns which they will generate. So the fact remains that if at all you want to maintain the excellent asset quality, you should be in a position to lend at the most competitive rates and for lending at the most competitive rates, you must be in a position to keep a check on your cost of resources. It is a very fine balance which people have to maintain because there are multiple stakeholders whose aspirations must be honored.


In the retail segment, growth was at a very high pace, at about 30% for many of the entities and that too in the very low ticket size. A little greater analysis revealed that much of it was being given based upon the spending patterns, whereas prudent lending principle suggests that it should be based upon the ability of people to repay, which means that their EMI to NMI (Net Monthly Income) ratio becomes very critical. That is the reason why perhaps RBI came down on the unsecured loans. Such entities were not having enough recovery mechanisms in place. RBI came down with such prescriptions to ensure that there should be orderly growth in the system and there should not be unhealthy growth.


Across the globe, the financial sector is very tightly regulated. The safety and security of the system is a function of the safety and security of all the players who are there in the ecosystem. FinTechs have a capability, they are very agile, they are in a position to offer solutions to a problem and to that extent, they actually create value for the system. As an entity, we are consuming the services of Fintech. But, yes of course, being a regulated entity, this is something which is on the top of our mind always, that anything which we do, it should be in line with what is the prescription from the regulator. Whereas as a part of DNA, they are more independent in terms of their thinking, in terms of offering solutions. It is for the mutual benefit for fintechs to understand and appreciate the ecosystem and the regulatory environment and for entities like banks to consume their services so that even banks become nimble. Fintechs can, you know, play second fiddle or substitute the bank's efforts rather than trying to be something on their own.


We have to stay ahead of the curve and for that we have to keep on investing in terms of understanding the evolving trends and how we should strengthen our risk management capabilities. Even in the good times, we are having a sharper focus on the risk management capability of the bank and we are investing well in terms of understanding the risk. We are having this sort of modelling for all kinds of risks. For the time being things look perfectly okay. We should have the mitigants in place. The fundamental principle is that the balance sheet should always remain strong",The economic times
CCI proposes changes to confidential info sharing,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 AM IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has proposed to amend the so-called ""confidentiality ring"" regime that governs the treatment of confidential information in its proceedings, seeking to streamline the processes and prevent any delays in disposal of cases.

The regime, introduced in 2022, allows parties involved in a case to have access to confidential information or documents relating to other parties in an investigation to better defend themselves, subject to riders.

The draft regulations released by the anti-trust regulator have set a time frame for seeking and granting access to confidential information.

The CCI has proposed that the party seeking access to confidential information must request for setting up a confidentiality ring at the earliest. If such a request is made by a party after the receipt of the non-confidential version of the investigation report, it will be made within seven days, with a provision to give another 7 days, subject to conditions. The regulator has sought stakeholder comments on the draft proposals until March 27.

Neelambera Sandeepan, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said the proposed amendments aim to ""prevent delays caused in enforcement proceedings on account of accessibility of confidential documents"". They also specify conditions and circumstances as to when the confidentiality rings can be set up, she said.

A party seeking confidentiality over the information or documents furnished by it will set out cogent reasons for such a treatment, the draft said. The party must specify the date on which such confidential treatment will expire on a self-certification basis, it said.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

A legal challenge would probably follow such an action, which would be in opposition to the long-standing interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

""A merit-based immigration system that protects American labour and promotes American values"" is what Trump has pledged to pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he suspended numerous work visas and implemented measures to restrict access to certain visa programs during his first time in office.",The economic times
States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.

However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a fiscal deficit target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.

The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

The states have so far drawn down 31.5 per cent more debt this fiscal at Rs 8.143 lakh crore as against Rs 6.193 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:57:00 AM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.


“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.




The Dow led lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.

Ruling BJP kills two birds with one stone in Uttar Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:49:00 AM IST","Lucknow: BJP's strategy to bring SP MLAs to its side and garner the magic number for the victory of its eighth Rajya Sabha candidate also conceals a well-thought-out plan of strengthening itself in some weak Lok Sabha seats to which some MLAs belong, while giving a jolt to Samajwadi Party's morale ahead of the general elections.

At least seven SP MLAs are suspected to have cross-voted for BJP's candidates on Tuesday. The spadework for Tuesday likely began at least a fortnight ago, after which, assured of extra support, Sanjay Seth was brought in as the surprise eighth candidate by BJP. The party needed eight extra votes for Seth's win. Alarm bells first rang when eight SP MLAs skipped the dinner hosted by chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday and remained unreachable. On Tuesday morning, the first blow was dealt by SP MLA from Unchahar, Raebareli, Manoj Pandey, who resigned from the post of chief whip of the party before the voting commenced. Later, these MLAs were seen posing with deputy CM Brajesh Pathak confirming all doubts. Akhilesh Yadav declared that all who have cross-voted will be ousted from the party.

Observers say BJP has achieved two objectives. Not only will this deal a blow to SP, some MLAs, who have cross-voted and will likely be seen in BJP in the coming days, represent parts of Lok Sabha seats which BJP views as a challenge like Raebareli and Ambedkarnagar.

Apart from Raebareli Sadar assembly seat which is represented by BJP's Aditi Singh, all the remaining four assembly seats of the Raebareli LS constituency are occupied by SP, in what could have made it an uphill battle for BJP, coupled with the fact that it is a Congress bastion. Pandey's switchover, considering his credentials as a strong Brahmin face, will provide a significant boost to the party's prospects there and he may even be fielded as the BJP candidate from the seat, as is being speculated.

Top BJP leaders head to Bihar as Lok Sabha polls draw near,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:33:00 AM IST","New Delhi: Within a fortnight beginning Wednesday, BJP's top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, will address public meetings in Bihar as part of BJP-led NDA's aim to win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The coalition, which won 39 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming for a clean sweep bolstered by JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar's return.

On March 2, Modi will address two public meetings in Aurangabad and Begusarai. This will be his first visit to Bihar after Kumar switched sides and rejoined NDA. Modi and Kumar will share the stage in Aurangabad after a long time.

Singh will visit Bihar on Wednesday. He will visit Sitamarhi and Darbhanga to address meetings. On Thursday, Shah will review poll preparedness and address a meeting of party workers near Patna.

The opposition camp too is planning a show of strength with a joint rally in Patna on March 3 in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to participate. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been touring the state as part of his Jan Vishwas Yatra, which will conclude on February 29.

"Shami undergoes ankle surgery, set to miss IPL","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:31:00 AM IST","Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami has undergone a successful surgery on his left achilles tendon, which rules him out of next month's Indian Premier League and possibly the T20 World Cup in June. The 33-year-old, who last played for India in the ODI World Cup final against Australia on November 19, went under the knife in London on Monday.

Shami, who is eager to ""get back on my feet soon"" stares at a recovery time of a minimum of three months.

He will thus miss the IPL slated to be played from March 22 to May 26, as reported by PTI last week.

Shami is also a doubtful starter for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.

""Just had a successful heel operation on my achilles tendon! Recovery is going to take some time, but looking forward to getting back on my feet,"" Shami tweeted, along with several pictures of him in the hospital, on X on Monday.

— MdShami11 (@MdShami11)

Shami, who was one of the architects of India's stupendous ODI World Cup campaign with 24 wickets, had played through pain as he had problems with his landing but didn't let it affect his performance.

He had flown to London in January to take special ankle injections. However, the medication didn't work and the fast bowler had to opt for surgery.

The absence of Shami is a major blow for Gujarat Titans, who have also traded all-rounder Hardik Pandya to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash deal. Shami was the side's highest wicket-taker during their runner-up finish in IPL last year.

Shami, who was recently conferred with the Arjuna Award, has 229 Test, 195 ODI and 24 T20 wickets in his decade-long career.

The development raises a question mark about the injury rehabilitation management programme planned by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for Shami.

It is also highly unlikely that the pacer would be able to make a comeback before India's Test matches at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand (October November).

His target could be the marquee away series against Australia.

Army called in amid fresh tension in Manipur; Assam Rifles deployed after senior cop abducted briefly,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:25:00 AM IST","The Army was called in as fresh tension mounted in Manipur on Tuesday and four columns of the Assam Rifles were deployed in Imphal East after a senior police officer was abducted allegedly by cadres of the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation, from his residence, officials said. The officer, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumar, posted in the operations wing of the Manipur Police, was rescued after a swift action by police and security forces, the officials said.

The officer has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

Giving details of the incident that took place around 7 pm on Tuesday, the officials said that a group of cadres owing allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol attacked the house of Kumar at Wangkhei in Imphal East.

The reason for this indiscriminate firing was that the officer concerned had arrested six members of the group for their alleged involvement in vehicle theft, the officials said.

Following the arrests, a group of Meira Paibis (Meitei women group) had protested and blocked roads demanding their release.

In the Tuesday evening attack, armed cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol ransacked the house and damaged at least four vehicles with gunfire, they said.

Detailing the chaotic events, M Kulla, the police officer's father, explained, ""We tried to talk to the armed men after they entered, but all of a sudden they started firing at the vehicles and properties. So we had to rush inside and lock ourselves.""

The father, according to the officials, called his son and informed about the incident.

The officer rushed with his team only to be abducted as they were outnumbered by the cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol.

The Manipur Police acted promptly, mobilising forces to launch a successful rescue operation, ensuring Kumar's safe return within hours.

The state government had to take help of the Army as the situation worded after the rescue efforts.

Officials said that four columns of the Assam Rifles were requisitioned and deployed around the area where the incident took place. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is not applicable in valley areas.

The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, functions under the operational command of the Army.

The region has witnessed escalating violence since May 3, with over 180 casualties reported after a ""Tribal Solidarity March"" in the hill districts protested the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

The Meiteis, constituting around 53 per cent of Manipur's population and residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, contrast the tribals, including Nagas and Kukis, who make up 40 per cent and primarily inhabit the hill districts.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Jubilant Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like Zomato and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Who sells what?
Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. Restaurant Brands Asia operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. Westlife Foodworld runs McDonald's in western India and South India. Jubilant Food operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Which QSR stocks to buy?
Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate Restaurant Brands Asia for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.

NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

BJP wins eight Rajya Sabha seats; SP bags two seats in UP,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:04:00 PM IST","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday won eight, out of ten, Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, SP bagged two seats in the state.

Voting in the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh began around 9 am on Tuesday. The BJP had fielded eight candidates and the Samajwadi Party (SP) three.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

""The manner in which the counting has begun and Opposition leaders are threatening the polling officers again and again is not right for democracy...They had halted the counting for long. I urge the Himachal BJP unit leaders to have patience, don't put pressure on people...CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 MLAs,"" CM Sukhu told reporters on Tuesday.

He further said that, ""I can say that the people who have gone away are being contacted by their families, I urge them to contact their families...There is no need to worry.""

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan
What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

The step was taken in order to develop the onshore rupee non-deliverable derivatives contract market and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently plan their hedging activities, the RBI said.

Such transactions would be cash-settled in rupees and shall have the flexibility of cash settlement between two relevant banks and between a bank and a person residing outside India in rupees or any foreign currency.",The economic times
Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Powered By
Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times

Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru."" The biggest challenge, he pointed out, for such projects specially in metros like Delhi, is land acquisition, said Bhagat.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

Indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge inducted into Indian Army,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:56:00 PM IST","A 46-metre indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge was inducted into the Indian Army on Tuesday, a move that will bolster the crucial bridging capability of the force's engineers. The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

SC to Centre: Take call on standard hospital charges or we may slap CGHS rates,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:05 IST","NEW DELHI: A cataract surgery could cost up to Rs 10,000 per eye in a govt hospital and Rs 30,000-1,40,000 in a private facility. Supreme Court Tuesday took strong exception to this disparity and inability of the Centre to implement a 14-year-old law-Clinical Establishment (Central Government) Rules-mandating notification of a standard rate in consultation with states for treatment and procedures of ailments in metros, cities and towns.

Govt told SC though it had repeatedly written to states on this, they didn't respond. SC said citizens have a fundamental right to healthcare and the Centre can't shirk its responsibility on this ground.

It asked Union health secretary to call a meeting of his state counterparts to ensure notification of a standard rate within a month. ""If Union govt fails to find a solution, then we will consider petitioner's plea for implementing CGHS-prescribed standardised rates,"" SC warned.

'Use central laws if states don't fix uniform hospital charges'
A PIL by NGO 'Veterans Forum for Transparency in Public Life' through advocate Danish Zubair Khan had sought a direction to Centre to determine rate of fee chargeable from patients in terms of Rule 9 of Clinical Establishment (Central Govt) Rules, 2012.
Under the Rules, all hospitals and clinical establishments, to keep intact their registration, must ""display rates charged for each type of service provided and facilities available for benefit of patients at a conspicuous place in vernacular as well as in English language; and charge rates for each type of procedures and services within range of rates determined and issued by Centre from time to time, in consultation with state govts.""


Petitioner told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta that Centre acted promptly in notifying standardised rates for treatment of patients during Covid and that if states did not cooperate in framing range of rates for treatment of ailments, it could use powers under central laws to unilaterally notify fees to be charged for different procedures.

"Elon Musk raises his Microsoft 'customer care' complaint directly to Satya Nadella, here's what he said","Feb 27, 2024, 16:23 IST","Clearly the text didn’t seem to have worked. Elon Musk yesterday tweeted that he had sent a message to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a problem he was having with his new Windows PC. Now, Musk has replied to a tweet made by Nadella on Microsoft’s latest acquisition. “Satya, I don’t mean to be a pest, but please allow people setting up a new Windows PC to skip creating a Microsoft account,” Musk said.
He further added that “this option disappears if the computer is connected to WiFi.”
Musk also revealed that he doesn’t have a personal email ID and Microsoft doesn’t allow to sign up with a work email ID. “Also, even if you do want to sign up, it won’t allow you use a work email address and I only *have* work emails addresses!”
Musk's tweets highlight a common user pain point. While Microsoft accounts offer features like OneDrive storage and app integration, many users prefer the option to avoid creating yet another online account, especially when setting up a new device. A user did point out that Musk had bypassed many customer support levels by reaching out to Nadella himself. Nadella hasn’t replied to Musk — at least not on X. Microsoft has not commented on the issue either.
The Tesla CEO specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it ""messed up.”

"They supped & drank together on Monday night, backstabbed me on Tuesday, says Abhishek Singhvi","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:32 IST","NEW DELHI: Abhishek Singhvi may be used to winning the knottiest of legal cases but on Tuesday, what he thought was a 'win' soon turned out to be a loss.
As the candidate for the lone HP seat, he ended up in an unexpected tie with rival Harsh Mahajan, thanks to cross-voting by some MLAs, necessitating a draw of lots to decide the result. As luck, or rather ill-luck, would have it, Singhvi did win the draw of lots, only to get eliminated in a cruel twist of fate.
The unusual way to pick a winner in the event of equal votes polled by candidates where only one RS seat is to be filled is thanks to Rule 75(4) of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.
As per the rule, where two or more candidates get same value of votes for a lone RS seat, the candidate with the lowest number of original votes, where this number is same for all, is to be excluded by a draw of lots.
""The RO puts slips with names of the candidates in a box, which is shaken before the slips are drawn. The candidate whose slip is drawn is eliminated/excluded, and whose slip remains in the box is declared winner,"" an EC functionary explained. ""It is written in the stars and written by God. In a normal draw of lots, the name taken out wins. Under strange rule of EC the name taken out of the box, which was mine, loses... is excluded,"" Singhvi later said at a press conference.

A high-voltage drama unfolded on Tuesday as a host of SP MLAs started grouping in favour of saffron camp as voting started. SP chief whip and Unchahar MLA Manoj Pandey resigned from the post on Tuesday morning.

"AAP fields three MLAs, one ex-MP for Delhi Lok Sabha seats","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:19 IST","NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party, led by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, on Tuesday announced its candidates for four Lok Sabha seats in Delhi and one in Haryana, which it is contesting as part of a seat-sharing deal with Congress under the banner of INDIA.
AAP put its faith in three sitting Delhi MLAs to contest from East, South and New Delhi seats and former Congress lawmaker Mahabal Mishra, who later crossed over, from West Delhi.

AAP has picked an SC candidate and Kondli MLA Kuldeep Kumar for East Delhi, which was described as a ""revolutionary step"" by Kejriwal in a video message on X. Kejriwal said only AAP is fulfilling the dream of Babasaheb Ambedkar.

AAP's Haryana president and former Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta will contest from Kurukshetra.
Three-time Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti will be contest from New Delhi while two-time MLA from Tughlaqabad, Sahiram Pahalwan, has been fielded from South Delhi.

'Candidates decided after consultations with Congress'
AAP's Kurukshetra candidate Sushil Gupta was associated with Congress and even fought the assembly election in 2013 from Moti Nagar in Delhi. He later joined AAP and was nominated in 2018 by the party to Rajya Sabha. He has been associated with several philanthropic organisations and his educational institutions serve more than 15,000 students in Delhi and Haryana.

Congress will contest three seats - Northwest (SC), Northeast and Chandni Chowk- in Delhi and nine in Haryana. In 2019, BJP had won all 10 seats in Haryana and all seven in Delhi. Both parties are yet to announce their candidates for Delhi.
AAP and Congress announced their seat-sharing deal on Saturday. AAP's political affairs committee, chaired by Kejriwal, met on Tuesday to decide on the names. Delhi ministers Gopal Rai and Atishi and AAP national general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak announced the candidates at a press conference. Atishi said the main criterion for selection was presence of candidates among people. ""If you ask about our four candidates, people from their areas will say they are available 24x7 for public service,"" she said.

Asked whether candidate selection has been done in coordination with Congress, Pathak said, ""We have taken this decision with a mutual understanding. However, it is the prerogative of every political party to field a candidate of its choice.""
AAP has already announced its candidates for Bharuch and Bhavnagar in Gujarat and three candidates in Assam. However, AAP is yet to decide on the biggest chunk of 13 seats in Punjab where the party and Congress will go solo in LS polls.

She alleged that the accused entered the ICU at around 3.30am, drew the curtains, and engaged in obscene acts in front of her. Upon her protest, he gave an injection and raped her.
The crime was captured on the hospital's CCTV cameras, which showed the accused approaching the woman. Following her complaint, police arrested the man and initiated an investigation, registering a case against him.

Wife jumps to death after husband dies by heart attack at Delhi zoo,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:44 IST","NEW DELHI: Friends from college who got married last Nov, Abhishek and Anjali - both in their 20s - died within hours of each other at the same hospital as tragedy befell the couple just when they had set out to make memories.
Feb 26 was special - the day they had decided to be together. This Monday, they marked the day as 'Mr & Mrs' for the first time with an outing to Delhi zoo.

Abhishek, 25, who worked with a Delhi-based NGO, had a heart attack and slumped to the ground in pain as they walked around the zoo. By late evening, Abhishek was declared dead by doctors.
Unable to bear the loss, Anjali, 23, jumped from the balcony of the couple's 7th-floor condominium in Vaishali, soon after the body of her husband was brought home.

Cops probe why man not taken to hospital close to Delhi zoo
Earlier, at the zoo, a relative had responded to Anjali's SOS and called an ambulance which took him to GTB hospital.
When Abhishek's condition didn't improve, doctors referred him to Safdarjung hospital. ""At the hospital, his wife Anjali fainted in the evening and was persuaded by her relatives to return home,"" a Ghaziabad police officer told TOI on Tuesday.


An hour after she had left, Abhishek passed away. ""The body reached home around 9.30pm on Monday. Anjali would not stop crying and locked herself in her room,"" ACP Swatantra Singh said.
Minutes later, guards at the society heard a scream and a thud. Anjali had jumped from the balcony of their apartment, which the couple shared with Abhishek's parents. ""She was still breathing when a police team reached her. She died during treatment around 8am on Tuesday,"" the ACP said.
Anjali was initially taken to a nearby private hospital and from there to Safdarjung, the same place where Abhishek had died hours earlier.
""Preliminary investigation revealed the couple had gone to Delhi zoo and wanted to spend the whole day there. All of a sudden, the husband complained of a pinching pain in the chest and collapsed,"" said a source.

A relative said the two had been in a relationship for several years and it had taken them several months to convince their parents about the marriage. ""I don't know how Abhishek suffered a heart attack at such a young age. He was a fitness freak - he played multiple sports and would hit the gym regularly,"" the relative said, adding, ""When they went out on Monday, they had said they would have lunch and dinner outside and get back late.""
Police said they were talking to relatives to find out why Abhishek was taken to GTB hospital - which is an hour away from Delhi zoo - when there are other hospitals nearby.
Doctors said the ""golden hour"" is crucial for patients who suffer a heart attack. ""Youngsters should assess their risk factors regularly and get health checks done. People with a family history of diabetes, heart ailments or hypertension are also prone to such risks. It is in the interest of everyone that people are trained in giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which will help in saving more lives,"" said Dr Vivek Tandon, additional director (interventional cardiology) at Fortis Hospital.

Meet 4 astronauts selected for Isro's Gaganyaan mission,"Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 19:06 IST","BENGALURU: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday bestowed the astronaut wings and introduced to the world the four astronaut-designates: Group Captain Prashanth Nair, Group Captain Angad Prathap, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan and Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, for Indian Space Research Organisation's (Isro) Gaganyaan's mission .
All four, short-listed four years ago, are Indian Air Force (IAF) test pilots from Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) in Bengaluru.

The TOI had reported in its Tuesday edition, based on sources that the astronauts-elect are Prashanth Nair, Angad Prathap and Ajit Krishnan, whom the PM introduced, but the fourth name sources had indicated to TOI, test pilot Chavan (whose full name was not immediately available), was not among the selected four — the fourth name was Shukla.

""After 40 years, an Indian will go to space, but this time, the time is also ours, the countdown is also ours. In every nation’s progress, there comes a time when the present introduces its people to the future. Today is such a time for India. Our current generation is blessed because they are able to see success in water, on ground and even in space. This is the beginning of a new era, where India is increasing its space in the global order and it is very visible even in the space sector,"" PM Modi said.

""Last year, India became the first country to land in the south pole region of Moon. Today, Shivshakti point introduces the whole world to India’s success. Today, we are part of another historic moment. The country, for the first time, got introduced to the four astronauts-elect. These are not just four names or four people. They are those who will take 140 crore aspirations to space,"" he added.
Congratulating all the astronauts-elect, PM Modi said their names will be etched as part of the 21st century and commended them for training rigorously for the past four years. He said yoga will also play an important role in their training as it will help keep a healthy body and mind, which is crucial.
Isro chairman S Somanath said: ""Three important projects are being dedicated to the nation which have been completed on time. These mark significant additions to Isro infrastructure. We’ve seen tremendous progress made by Isro with the kind of missions, especially, Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 which made the world turn back to look at India. The 2047 vision made public has ambitious projects to make India Viksit Bharat and Isro will work towards achieving this.""
The projects Somanath referred to are the PSLV integration facility at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota; semi-cryogenics integrated engine and stage test facility at Isro propulsion complex in Mahendragiri; and Trisonic wind tunnel at VSSC. He added: “This is a golden letter day for Isro having the PM amid us. This is the first time a PM is visiting this Isro facility in 40 years.
In July 2019, TOI first reported that all astronaut-elects for Gaganyaan would be test pilots given that it was India’s first human spaceflight mission and by virtue of their specialisations, test pilots have always been called upon to study deeply all that can probably go wrong in something that has not been tried before.
While a large number of test pilots had enrolled to become astronauts, 12 of them made it past the first level of selection completed in Sept 2019 in Bengaluru. The selection was done at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), an institute under the Indian Air Force (IAF).
After multiple rounds of selection, the IAM and Isro then shortlisted the final four. By early 2020, Isro sent the four test pilots to Russia for initial training, which after some delay induced by Covid-19, was completed in 2021.
Since then, the four have been undergoing various training modules in India. Isro has tied up with multiple agencies, including from the armed forces for the same. Isro has also been working on equipping its Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) with various simulators for the training. They are also continuing with their regular flying with IAF to remain fit, while other fitness regimes are also part of their routine.
“I request the citizens and specifically the media to cooperate in the future. The astronauts-elect have continuously done penance for the past four years. They have done this without making themselves visible. They still have a long way to go, there are many challenges. But now, they’ve become celebrities, I know people will want autographs and selfies and the media would also want to know everything about their lives. But this could be detrimental to their achievements. The real story is beginning now. We need to cooperate with them and their families so they can focus on enabling the ambitious goal,” PM Modi said.
The Prime Minister said that during his review of Gaganyaan, he found that most of the systems used will be made in India. As India strives to become the third largest economy, the space sector, through indigenisation of systems like in Gaganyaan, is enabling that.
He also reiterated how the space sector is giving preference for 'women power' and that there's no mission, whether Chandrayaan or Gaganyaan, that can be conceived without the participation of women. There are more than 500 women in leadership positions in Isro. I congratulate all of them.
""The space sector is also kindling scientific temper among the youth. There are many children who look at Isro and want to become scientists. The countdown inspires lakhs of children. The aeronautical engineer in every home that is flying paper planes wants to grow up and become space scientists,"" he said.
""During Chandrayaan-2 landing, a lot of children watched it and learnt a lot of things. And then came August 23, 2024, which inspired a lot of Children and we’ve now named it National Space Day. You’ve had many records in Space. You reached Mars in the first attempt. We’ve launched more than 100 satellites in a single mission. You’ve sent Aditya-L1 to an orbit that’s 15-lakh-km away, not many countries have been able to do this. And in the short time of 2024 so far, you’ve already launched XpoSAT and Insat-3DS,"" PM Modi added.
In the next 10 years, Indian space economy will increase five-fold to touch $40 billion. ""India will become a big commercial hub for space and we will return to Moon in the coming years. We'll bring samples back from there to increase our understanding and we'll also explore Venus. By 2035, we'll have a space station. And not just this, within this Amrit Kaal an Indian astronaut will land on Moon using an Indian spacecraft and rocket,"" the Prime Minister further added.

"Narendra Modi flays DMK and Congress, praises MGR and Jayalalithaa","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:36 IST","PALLADAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at DMK and Congress on Tuesday but heaped praises on AIADMK icons MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa signalling that BJP was keeping the option of allying with AIADMK open.
Speaking at the valedictory meeting of BJP state president K Annamalai’s ‘En Mann En Makkal’ padayatra at Madappur near Palladam in Tamil Nadu’s Tirupur district, Modi said MGR was lauded as an incomparable leader by the people of TN because he had given good education and public health.

“He came to power through good deeds, not through dynasty. But the DMK is insulting him today,’’ Modi said, noting that he visited MGR’s place of birth in Sri Lanka during his recent trip to the island nation.
“After MGR, it was `Amma’ Jayalalithaa who gave good governance in Tamil Nadu,’’ the PM said. “She dedicated her entire life for the people of TN. I pay her my tributes. It was because of her service that she lives in the heart of Tamil Nadu people even today,’’ Modi said.

Modi’s speech comes in the backdrop of a shadow boxing between Tamil Nadu BJP and its erstwhile ally AIADMK attempting to poach leaders from each other.
Ever since AIADMK walked out of NDA in September last year, the BJP could not lure any major political parties into its fold in Tamil Nadu, except Tamil Maanila Congress, a light weight in the state. AIADMK has clarified that it will not patch up with BJP again. BJP for its part has begun stitching its own alliance in the state.

Modi’s remarks indicate that the saffron party keeps its option open for an AIADMK alliance.
Hitting out at DMK and Congress, Modi said the fate of INDIA front was sealed in Delhi. But the opposition front was trying to stay alive in TN to “to loot people in TN,” he said.
“It is time to lock their shop which has been opened to loot people,” he said. The right lock meant to shut the DMK – Congress shop has been created using the `En Mann En Makkal’ yatra, he said.
Listing out the welfare programmes -- including two defence corridors -- the BJP-led central government has implemented in TN, he asked if the Congress would implement such development schemes if it came to power. “Will those who received bribes to procure weapons allow development of defence corridors here?’’ he asked.
Modi said BJP had always prioritised growth of TN. “We have given more to TN in the last ten years than what the DMK-Congress alliance had given between 2004 and 2014,” he said. Hence, BJP has captured the hearts of people in TN, though the party was never in power in the state.
That was the reason, those who were looting TN for years are spreading lies, creating confusion and dividing people to hold on to power. “Their drama, however, has been exposed. Their corruption is being brought to light everyday,” he said in an apparent reference to corruption cases against DMK ministers.
Modi said BJP has emerged as a force to reckon with in TN and the party would create history in 2024.
BJP’s allies G K Vasan, A C Shanmugam and Devanathan Yadav were present on the stage along with BJP leaders L Murugan and K Annamalai in the public meeting touted as a biggest show of strength by BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections.
Modi who landed at Sulur Air Force base in Coimbatore took a chopper to reach the meeting venue. From the helipad he came to the stage, designed like a lotus, on an open jeep waving to the crowd amidst slogans `Vendum Modi, Meendum Modi.’
The yatra inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah in Rameswaram in June last year covered all the assembly constituencies.

"Rohit Sharma is the next MS Dhoni, says Suresh Raina","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 12:36 IST","NEW DELHI: No Mohammed Shami? No problem. No Virat Kohli? No problem either. India captain Rohit Sharma led a young Team India to a series-clinching win in Ranchi.
India defeated England by 5 wickets in a thrilling contest in the fourth Test to take an unassailable 3-1 lead. The fifth and the last Test match will be played in Dharamsala from March 7.
In the absence of premier pacer Shami, star batsman Virat, and middle order star Shreyas Iyer, Rohit showed confidence in the newcomers by handing Test debuts to Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and pacer Akash Deep.

India pulled off a tricky chase of 192 on day four in Ranchi, with wicketkeeper-batsman Jurel (39) and Shubman Gill (52) sharing an unbeaten stand of 72.
Man-of-the-match Jurel, who debuted in the Rajkot Test, made a significant impact by scoring 90 runs, rescuing India from a precarious position of 177 for 7 in the first innings to a total of 307 on day three.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the standout performer, amassing 655 runs in four matches, including two double centuries in the second and third Test matches.

Bengal pacer Akash Deep made an immediate impression on his debut, unsettling England with three wickets on the opening day of the Ranchi Test. Akash Deep was included in the playing eleven after pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested.
Middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan also impressed on debut in Rajkot when he scored 62 and 68 not out in India's 434-run hammering of England.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hailed captain Rohit for his brilliant calls and for using young players in the Test series against England.
TimesofIndia.com caught up with Raina, who is representing Uttar Pradesh in the Indian Veteran Premier League (IVPL), and spoke about Rohit's captaincy, Juel's knock, MS Dhoni, and much more...
Rohit Sharma used his young players really well in the series...
He is the next MS Dhoni. He has done well. He has been giving a lot of chances to youngsters the way MS Dhoni did. I played a lot of cricket under MS Dhoni. Sourav Ganguly supported his team a lot. Then MS Dhoni came and led from the front. Rohit is going in the right direction. He is a brilliant captain.
On Dhruv Jurel, the Man of the Match...
I have played matches with Jurel for Uttar Pradesh. I want to give credit to Rohit Sharma. He first gave Sarfaraz the chance and then made Jurel part of the team. Jurel was just amazing. He played a superb knock in the first innings and then in the second. I am rating his knock special because the wicket was turning and he batted beautifully. He is so calm and composed. That's the best part of him. I am really impressed with his wicketkeeping. He was just amazing behind the wickets. He has got that fearless attitude since he comes from an Army family. He has worked hard for this. I have seen him working so hard at the nets. I just want to wish him all the best.


Akash Deep was phenomenal in the debut Test. Your comments?
He has bowled really well. He came from Bihar and represented Bengal then. It was quite a journey and in the end all his hard work paid off. Rohit has been amazing with his planning. He has been giving a lot of chances to the youngsters. The way he is rotating the players is something I have never seen in the last couple of years. Whenever the fast bowlers came in the last couple of years, we have seen injuries. But Rohit has been managing that really well. Being a captain is not easy, especially when you are playing in India. Earlier, we used to have one fast bowler and 3-4 spinners. Now, he is bringing two fast bowlers. He brought in Siraj and Bumrah. He sent Bumrah back and managed his workload well and then handed debut to Akash Deep. Rohit has been handling the pressure and players really well.

Will this be MS Dhoni's last IPL?
I have no idea about this. But he is working really hard. He is looking really fit. This is up to him. He will be in a yellow jersey and entertain the fans. Fans just love him. He will do really well I am sure. He has given a lot to cricket.
On RCB's IPL trophy drought...
Virat deserves a trophy. He has done so well for the Indian team and RCB for years. He has had a lot of success at RCB and his fans deserve to hold a trophy for him.

"Apple Arcade reeks ""smell of death,"" say game developers","Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 18:27 IST","The future of Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, looks uncertain according to several mobile game developers who recently spoke to MobileGamer.biz. They report declining financial incentives, cancelled projects, opaque communications, and increasing confusion around Apple's long-term strategy for the platform.
Initially welcomed as a potential boon for premium mobile gaming, Arcade began facing troubles as payouts reportedly dropped and Apple severed ties with numerous original game studios mid-development during a strategy shift toward licensed family titles.
Insider whispers point to a possible reboot, but some question whether gaming can get requisite Apple leadership attention to succeed long-term.

Arcade strategy shift caught devs by surprise
Developers say that when Arcade launched back in September 2019, upfront payments were ""very generous,"" and revenue share arrangements after that were also lucrative enough that most, if not all, games released on the platform in the first couple of years were profitable straight out of the gate. Apple Arcade was seen as a lifeline for many smaller studios specialising in so-called ""premium"" games without free-to-play monetization elements.
But multiple developer say the monthly per-user ""bonus pool"" payouts feeding rev share totals started declining around October 2020 and have steadily dropped since. Then in Spring 2021, as part of a sudden ""reboot"" of Arcade's content strategy, Apple allegedly ""cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people,"" according to one unnamed source.

Developers' complaint service now focuses on family-friendly games with prominent licensed IP characters attached. It is supplemented only by the occasional new addition from its 'App Store Greats' series - essentially repurposed free-to-play games with ads and in-app purchases removed.
""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" said one unnamed studio head who met with Apple to discuss bringing their games onto Arcade.

Devs in the dark on Arcade's direction
This strategy shift hasn't been communicated to Apple's development partners, however. One indie studio head told MobileGamer that after months of glowing feedback from Apple on one of their titles in development, Arcade reps suddenly withdrew interest, citing unspecified strategy changes. When the studio offered to alter designs and reduce budgets to better fit Arcade, they received no reply.
Other developers who've met with Apple to discuss bringing titles onto Arcade walked away confused about the platform's direction. ""I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it,"" one source said, while another described a feeling that Arcade had the ""smell of death"" around it.
Upfront payments to developers for new Arcade titles have also steeply declined, sources say. And with bonus pool revenue share totals dropping every month, some studios are questioning the service's future viability. ""We're going to see that amount decrease and decrease until it's pennies,"" warned one developer. ""At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable.""
Studios say Apple reps have been vague or mysterious about how the opaque bonus pool payments are calculated, leaving developers in the dark. ""They have this metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that,"" a source told MobileGamer. ""But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is.""
Netflix emerges as competitor
Some paint Apple as “vindictive” and “spiteful” on Arcade, especially toward studios who sign deals with rival Netflix. But others say Arcade has benefited mobile gaming. ""Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy the Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile,"" one developer insisted.
Rumours suggest another Arcade reboot may be imminent as Apple looks to counter Netflix's expanding gaming subscription footprint. But multiple studio heads said they feel Apple lacks genuine passion for gaming. ""At the very top there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't,"" a source said.
Apple has been tight-lipped about the performance of its gaming subscription service, and the word around the town that there may be problems behind the scenes.

Byju’s to go ahead with rights issue after NCLT defers decision on investors’ plea; but there’s a catch,"Feb 27, 2024, 21:37 IST","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the plea filed by a few of Byju’s investors seeking the court’s intervention to declare the firm’s rights issue as void and the founders as unfit to run the company, citing oppression and mismanagement.
This essentially allows the company to go ahead with the rights issue which closes on February 28 but the company that is reeling under a cash crunch may not be able to immediately use the proceeds raised through the issue.
The NCLT, investor sources said, has observed that Byju’s board cannot increase authorised share capital on its own for the rights issue.
“The court directed that they (Byju’s) cannot complete the rights issue until they call for an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to increase authorised capital and take shareholder approval before proceeding for rights issue. In response, Byju’s gave an undertaking to the court that they will not use the proceeds of the rights issue until the authorisation has been secured.
The company is banking on its rights issue to raise capital and meet its current liabilities. It aims to secure $200 million through the issue at a valuation of $225-$230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion.

A few of the firm’s disgruntled investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic are yet to participate in the rights issue. If they don’t participate, their shareholding will get diluted. In the court, lawyers representing the investors are learnt to have argued that they have no visibility on how the funds raised through the rights issue will be used given there are so many ongoing investigations against the company.

“$533 million (the money raised as part of term loan which Byju’s Alpha allegedly transferred in an obscure hedge fund) has been siphoned off. He (Byju Raveendran) wants us to invest more money. How will we be protected? We have requested the company to provide information covering a broad range of matters. There are 13 letters we have written between the end of 2022 and end of 2023 asking for information,” the investors’ lawyers argued, adding that the company will not survive solely on the basis of the money coming in from the issue.
The NCLT has asked both the parties to provide written submissions of their arguments in three days. Byju’s has proposed to park the money raised through the rights issue in a fresh account so that it can be monitored. In a recent letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Raveendran had said that the startup will appoint a third-party agency to monitor the usage of funds raised through the issue. The NCLT petition has been signed by Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners along with support from other shareholders including Tiger Global and Owl Ventures. Through the petition, the investors are also seeking a forensic audit of the company and a directive to be issued to the startup against taking any corporate actions that will prejudice the rights of the investors.
Byju’s is locked in a bitter fight with its investors, majority of whom voted to oust him as the CEO and restructure the firm’s family-run board. The company claims that only 35 of 170 shareholders, representing around 45% of the shareholding voted in favour of the resolution passed at last week’s EGM. In a letter to employees, Raveendran said that he remains the CEO of the company and will challenge these “illegal and prejudicial actions.”",Times Of India
"Life for Russian political prisoners: 'Isolation, poor food & arbitrary punishment'","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:13 IST","Vladimir Kara-Murza could only laugh when officials in Penal Colony No. 6 inexplicably put a small cabinet in his already-cramped concrete cell, next to a fold-up cot, stool, sink and latrine. That moment of dark humour came because the only things he had to store in it were a toothbrush and a mug, said his wife, Yevgenia, since the opposition activist wasn't allowed any personal items in solitary confinement.

Another time, she said, Kara-Murza was told to collect his bedding from across the corridor - except that prisoners must keep their hands behind their backs whenever outside their cells. ""How was he supposed to pick it up? With his teeth?"" Yevgenia said. When he collected the sheets, a guard appeared and told him he violated the rules, bringing more discipline. Kara-Murza was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He is serving 25 years, the stiffest sentence for a Kremlin critic.
For political prisoners like Kara-Murza, life in Russia's penal colonies is a grim reality of physical and psychological pressure, sleep deprivation, insufficient food, health care that is poor or simply denied, and a dizzying set of arbitrary rules.
According to Memorial - a group founded to document repression, there are 680 political prisoners in Russia who are being held in increasingly severe conditions under President Vladimir Putin's crackdown. This month brought the stunning news from a remote Arctic penal colony, one of Russia's harshest facilities: the still-unexplained death of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's fiercest foe.

Most often, inmates live in barracks tightly packed with bunk beds. Konstantin Kotov, an activist who spent over a year in Penal Colony No. 2 , recalls cramped quarters of 60 men per room. Meals are unsatisfying: Breakfast was porridge, lunch was soup with little or no meat, mashed potatoes and a meat or fish cutlet; as was dinner. Inmates got two eggs a week, and fruit and vegetables were a luxury. Reports of physical abuse are common for ordinary inmates but rare for political prisoners, advocates say. Instead, intimidation often comes via enforcing minor infractions. Navalny spent months in a punishment cell for not buttoning his uniform properly or not putting his hands behind his back. He once described it as a ""concrete kennel"" of 8-by-10-feet that, depending on the season, was ""cold and damp,"" or ""hot and there's almost no air"".

New UPSC rule for photo on application form to tackle AI-morphed photo frauds,"Feb 27, 2024, 20:02 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has started the registration process for UPSC CSE Prelims 2024 this week for the Prelims scheduled in May. The Commission has introduced stricter rules for uploading photographs on the registration forms. As per the new guidelines, the UPSC has asked the candidates to upload photographs not older than 10 days from the start of the online application process.
Therefore, candidates will have to make sure that the photographs are not taken before February 4, 2024.
While the rule has baffled the aspirants and a few have dubbed it is an unnecessarily long and expensive process, experts claim it will control misuse of technology and other related frauds during the exams. In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, several cases have been registered by the state against candidates for impersonation and technology-related crimes.
Retired senior IAS officer JK Dadoo says this initiative will control misuse of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). With AI, there is a possibility to morph photographs and documents, which can pose serious challenges in the public examination. “It is difficult to distinguish between photographs of candidates on different forms and also match them against the candidates appearing in the exam. New technology and AI can easily morph photographs and documents. With the new UPSC guidelines, identification-related issue will get largely resolved,” says Dadoo.
“Several cases have come to the fore where candidates juxtaposed their photographs. With technologies like AI and deepfake, the challenges are rising each day. Identity issues are a major problem the Commission is facing. As per the new instructions, the candidate must upload a photo clicked within 10 days from the start of the online application process. This will make it difficult for the candidates to fudge the application data. The new process may pinch pockets, especially of aspirants from rural areas, but it will ensure the identity is correct, easing the future procedure,” adds Dadoo.

UPSC and state PSCs have received multiple complaints of impersonation where the photo of the person in the admit card and the one appearing for the exam were different. “Often, the admit card has the younger brother’s photo while the older brother appears for the exam. The recent instructions will just eliminate such possibilities,” says Dadoo.
Ease of doing business

Senior IAS Rajesh Kumar Pathak, secretary, Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, says, “The new initiative will just ease the process of doing business. It will also help in crosschecking the age and appearances of the candidate as very often they upload older photos. On numerous occasions, it becomes a challenge during the Personality Test, when the interviewers find little or no resemblance of the candidate with the photo he has uploaded during the registration, raising doubts among examiners.”

“The new system comes with a bit of challenge for the candidates, but it will increase transparency and control impersonation. Through the new system, the candidates will also not face any issues at any level during the exam.

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"Focus is on offering solutions against selling the products: Dinesh K Khara, Chairman, State Bank of India","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:44:00 AM IST","Much-needed private investments to quicken the pace of economic expansion are just ‘around the corner’, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara tells Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan, pointing to aggregate capacity utilisation reaching thresholds that have historically prompted corporate boards to draw up expansion plans.

Mumbai-based SBI, which reported record profits topping Rs 50,000 crore last fiscal year, is the winner of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in the Company of the Year category. In an interview touching upon a wide range of topics, Khara tells ET that India’s focus on building manufacturing muscle would further strengthen the growth capex trend and, in turn, banks that are expected to help finance India's spectacular and exciting journey along the competitiveness gradient. Edited excerpts:


There are a couple of reasons — a part of it comes from the macro and some part of it from the contribution from all the SBIians. It's more like a citizenship of the bank. Since the macro was doing well in terms of the demand which was demonstrated during Covid and also the enabling ecosystem created by the government, it created a very positive environment for the bank. Covid was the first test of resilience of the banking system and of the State Bank of India. The other piece was the positivity in the organisation that helped us in getting the best out of everyone at SBI. And when they started tasting success, their confidence improved. Ensuring the timely delivery and keeping a very close eye in terms of the quality of the loan book helped us in generating interest income where we were not required to make any provisions.


During Covid there were not enough opportunities for lending. But at the same time there are enough deposits. We went for the rupee dollar swaps and we supported our international balance sheet. We got into supply chain financing activity in our overseas operation. When we could see the demand coming up in India, we unwound those rupee dollar swaps and brought the money back and supported the growth in the domestic economy.


During Covid there was a reasonable demand we saw for retail growth. We looked at opportunities and worked out what all solutions we can offer. So orientation was changed in terms of offering solutions as against selling the products. We were quite cognizant of the fact that recovery of the economy will depend upon the growth of the SMEs. So, we started investing in terms of the infrastructure for SME, and ensured that each of the zonal offices of the bank, which are more than 100 across the country, had a AGM level officer who was responsible for SME loans and brought the sanctioning committees nearer to the ground. We had taken up the task to scale up this SME business to around `4 lakh crore and I am happy to share that today we have already crossed the `4 lakh crore and much before the financial year 2023-24 target we had set. Our SME book has got perhaps one of the lowest gross NPA which is at 4.33%.


We looked at the opportunities available and ensured that we have adequate infrastructure in place to ensure that we underwrite a quality book and we should have effective follow up... We came out with the loan management system. Now we have brought in the business division in SME. We came out with the pre-approved business loans. So we did a lot of work in this space and that is the reason why we can now see a Rs 4 lakh crore book which is very strong in terms of quality.


Our agri book was also stagnating for many years at about Rs 2 lakh crore. At that point of time we said that we should take it to Rs 3 lakh crore and today we are almost at that number — Rs 2.92 lakh crore.

In terms of quality also, even in this book we used to have high gross NPA, now it has been brought into the single digit. In the SME space, we also took help from our large corporate relationships. We started mapping their vendor distributor ecosystem end to end so that they will have a very dependable supply chain and also at the same time we would have the visibility of the cash flows for these enterprises.


There are a couple of things which have taken place in the ecosystem and this is essentially coming from the credit bureaus, particularly in the retail segment. Credit bureaus have changed the trajectory because there is enough and the clear visibility in terms of the credit history of the borrower. In retail, one should have the system structure in place unless and until the structure is well oiled, there can be challenges in retail. So that is the reason why we invested well in the structure. All our retail loans we have got the loan management system which are end to end digital and also it leaves hardly any discussion on ground and they are all having the business rule in general embedded into it. So when the scale goes up, there has to be uniformity in the underwriting standards. That is the reason why in our retail book, the gross NPA is actually less than 0.70%.


When it comes to private capex, there are different stages. Normally, it comes to the drawing board when the capacity utilization reaches somewhere around 75%. If we look at some of the numbers in 2022-23, we have seen the capital commitment to the tune of Rs 37 lakh crore by the private corporates. Also in the first half it is around Rs 20 lakh crore. When it comes to the growth in numbers there is always a lag between corporate credit and capital commitment. Once people have got a clear visibility of the demand, they start evaluating the options relating to the capex. The undisbursed limits for the term loans have been released. So that's a very clear reflection that there is a definite departure as compared to the past. That gives us the confidence that the private capex is just around the corner.


All the initiatives which have been taken by the government in terms of the infrastructure creation has also created an enabling environment because eventually the road and rail infrastructure which is getting created will lead to a situation where the logistic cost is going to come down. They are aiming to bring it down by half to about 7% and I think they are much on course. There is a very clear focus of orienting this economy to become manufacturing oriented. That also is going to be one of the other factors leading to even more capex commitments also.


We are quite well placed at current levels at somewhere around 67-68%. The RBI is not prescribing any credit deposit ratio, but nevertheless, there has to be enough deposit base so that there is enough muscle in the banking system to lend. What I expect is banks will be even more careful, and choosy in terms of picking up the assets which they should support. So that is something that appears to be the potential outcome.


CASA before Covid used to be around 40% in the system, so, I would say that it is actually coming back to the same levels after going to around 44% during Covid because there were not enough opportunities for people to spend money. Now people are coming back to spending habits. That's one aspect. The second aspect is that invariably we have seen that during inflationary times, there is a tendency on the part of all savers to put their money in high interest earning assets class. It is a part of the cycle.


Banking system would be Rs 200 lakh crore, mutual fund industry would be about Rs 50 lakh crore, life insurance is about Rs 60 lakh crore. Pension fund is about Rs 10 lakh crore, and I think when it comes to the stock market, it would be about Rs 300 odd lakh crore. That is the broad composition. Even if youngsters are putting their money into SIP, they will route it through the banking system. That money in any case has to be channelised through the system only. There will be competition vis-a-vis the fixed deposit but it is the financial literacy which will perhaps eventually guide.


Competition is a reality which none of us can ignore and obviously when it comes to banking to strike a fine balance between the cost of deposit and the returns which they will generate. So the fact remains that if at all you want to maintain the excellent asset quality, you should be in a position to lend at the most competitive rates and for lending at the most competitive rates, you must be in a position to keep a check on your cost of resources. It is a very fine balance which people have to maintain because there are multiple stakeholders whose aspirations must be honored.


In the retail segment, growth was at a very high pace, at about 30% for many of the entities and that too in the very low ticket size. A little greater analysis revealed that much of it was being given based upon the spending patterns, whereas prudent lending principle suggests that it should be based upon the ability of people to repay, which means that their EMI to NMI (Net Monthly Income) ratio becomes very critical. That is the reason why perhaps RBI came down on the unsecured loans. Such entities were not having enough recovery mechanisms in place. RBI came down with such prescriptions to ensure that there should be orderly growth in the system and there should not be unhealthy growth.


Across the globe, the financial sector is very tightly regulated. The safety and security of the system is a function of the safety and security of all the players who are there in the ecosystem. FinTechs have a capability, they are very agile, they are in a position to offer solutions to a problem and to that extent, they actually create value for the system. As an entity, we are consuming the services of Fintech. But, yes of course, being a regulated entity, this is something which is on the top of our mind always, that anything which we do, it should be in line with what is the prescription from the regulator. Whereas as a part of DNA, they are more independent in terms of their thinking, in terms of offering solutions. It is for the mutual benefit for fintechs to understand and appreciate the ecosystem and the regulatory environment and for entities like banks to consume their services so that even banks become nimble. Fintechs can, you know, play second fiddle or substitute the bank's efforts rather than trying to be something on their own.


We have to stay ahead of the curve and for that we have to keep on investing in terms of understanding the evolving trends and how we should strengthen our risk management capabilities. Even in the good times, we are having a sharper focus on the risk management capability of the bank and we are investing well in terms of understanding the risk. We are having this sort of modelling for all kinds of risks. For the time being things look perfectly okay. We should have the mitigants in place. The fundamental principle is that the balance sheet should always remain strong",The economic times
CCI proposes changes to confidential info sharing,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 AM IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has proposed to amend the so-called ""confidentiality ring"" regime that governs the treatment of confidential information in its proceedings, seeking to streamline the processes and prevent any delays in disposal of cases.

The regime, introduced in 2022, allows parties involved in a case to have access to confidential information or documents relating to other parties in an investigation to better defend themselves, subject to riders.

The draft regulations released by the anti-trust regulator have set a time frame for seeking and granting access to confidential information.

The CCI has proposed that the party seeking access to confidential information must request for setting up a confidentiality ring at the earliest. If such a request is made by a party after the receipt of the non-confidential version of the investigation report, it will be made within seven days, with a provision to give another 7 days, subject to conditions. The regulator has sought stakeholder comments on the draft proposals until March 27.

Neelambera Sandeepan, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said the proposed amendments aim to ""prevent delays caused in enforcement proceedings on account of accessibility of confidential documents"". They also specify conditions and circumstances as to when the confidentiality rings can be set up, she said.

A party seeking confidentiality over the information or documents furnished by it will set out cogent reasons for such a treatment, the draft said. The party must specify the date on which such confidential treatment will expire on a self-certification basis, it said.",The economic times
Why the US economy needs more immigrants,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:19:00 PM IST","A recent surge in immigration to the United States, projected to continue through 2026, is expected to have a significant impact on the nation's economy, labour market, and housing sector.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released updated projections on the US economy, factoring in a surge in immigration that began in 2022 and is expected to continue through 2026. This increased influx of people is anticipated to have a significant impact on the US economy and labour force.

Expanding Labour Force and Economic Growth
The CBO projects a continued rise in net immigration through 2026, contributing to a larger and younger workforce. This influx of immigrants, primarily in their prime working years (25-54 years old), is expected to offset the decline in labour force participation due to an aging population. The report has also forecasted a moderate expansion in the workforce through 2026.

This expansion in the labour force is expected to translate into increased economic output. The CBO estimates that the rise in immigration will add an average of 0.2 percentage points annually to the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2024 and 2034. This translates to a projected increase in real GDP of around 2% in 2034 compared to a scenario without significant immigration growth.

Impact on Wages and Productivity
While increased immigration is projected to benefit economic growth, the report has also acknowledged potential downsides for average real wages. New immigrants are likely to initially work in sectors with lower wages, putting downward pressure on average wages across the board. Also, the increased workforce reduces capital per worker, further affecting wages. However, these effects are expected to diminish over time as immigrants gain skills and integrate further into the labour market.

The CBO also foresees a long-term positive impact on productivity from the projected increase in immigration. Roughly 2% of the additional immigrants are expected to be highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. These workers are projected to contribute to innovation and boost total factor productivity (TFP), potentially outweighing the short-term negative effects by 2027.


Impact on the Housing Market
The CBO predicted a significant rise in residential investment due to the increased demand for housing associated with the growing population. They project average annual growth in real residential investment to jump to 10.8% in 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by declining mortgage interest rates and housing needs.

While net immigration is expected to slow down after 2024, its impact on housing is likely to persist into the second half of the 2020s as newly arrived immigrants gradually form their own households. A sustained level of housing construction activity in the coming years is also expected.

Population Projections and Labour Force Participation
The CBO has revised its population projections due to the anticipated increase in net immigration. The civilian population aged 16 or older in 2033 is now projected to be 7.4 million people larger than previously estimated, with most of this rise attributed to immigration. The projected labour force participation rate is also revised upwards, reflecting the larger share of individuals in the prime working age group (25-54) due to increased immigration.

Immigration and the US Elections
Immigration has already emerged as a major polarizing issue in the 2024 US presidential election.

While illegal immigration at the border has always been a bigger target for politicians - arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high in December 2023 - Donald Trump has laid out a plan to curb legal migration into the country too, if voted back to power.

A legal challenge would probably follow such an action, which would be in opposition to the long-standing interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

""A merit-based immigration system that protects American labour and promotes American values"" is what Trump has pledged to pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he suspended numerous work visas and implemented measures to restrict access to certain visa programs during his first time in office.",The economic times
States' borrowing cost decline marginally to 7.44 per cent,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:38:00 PM IST","The borrowing cost for states continued to fall for the third week in a row, with the weighted average price falling to 7.44 per cent in the debt auction on Tuesday. The cost had remained at a two-year high throughout January sniffing at 7.8 per cent.

However, the overall cost has been falling since the interim Union Budget, which forecast a lower than anticipated borrowing and a fiscal deficit target of 5.8 per cent for this fiscal and 5.1 per cent for the next financial year.

The weighted average cut-off rate eased by 2 basis points to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday, with issuance trailing the indicated amount for the fifth consecutive week, Icra Rating said in a note.

Twelve states raised Rs 32,800 crore through State Government Securities (SGS) on February 27 and the amount is 27 per cent lower than the highest-ever weekly auction of Rs 45,200 crore indicated for this week in the fourth quarter auction calendar.

Both limited supply and the falling overall interest rates pulled down the weighted average cut-off to 7.44 per cent on Tuesday from 7.46 per cent last week despite a mild increase in the weighted average tenor to 14 years from 13 years, Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra, said.

Accordingly, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year state bonds and the 10-year G-Sec (Government Securities) yield declined to 37 basis points on Tuesday from 41 basis points last week, she added.

The states have so far drawn down 31.5 per cent more debt this fiscal at Rs 8.143 lakh crore as against Rs 6.193 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal.

"Vodafone Idea plans to raise Rs45K crore via equity, debt","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:57:00 AM IST","Cash-strapped telco Vodafone Idea announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt.

The company’s board on Tuesday approved equity fund raise of upto Rs 20,000 crore by way of equity-linked instruments which could be convertible debentures, warrants, or other securities convertible into Equity Shares, Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts or Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds.

“The promoters will also participate in the proposed equity raise, as committed earlier,” Vi said in an exchange filing on Tuesday. The company had previously said that one of its promoters (read: Aditya Birla Group) has committed to infuse Rs2,000 crore when required.


“In addition, the company remains actively engaged with its lenders for tying-up the debt funding, which will follow the equity fund raise. Through a combination of equity and debt, the Company plans to raise around Rs. 45,000 crore. The Company’s bank debt currently stands at less than Rs. 4,500 crore,” it said.

The Board has also authorized the management to appoint various intermediaries, including bankers and counsels to execute the fund raise. The Company will call for a meeting of its shareholders on April 2, 2024 and post-shareholder approval it expects to complete the equity fund raise in the coming quarter, it said.

The equity and debt fund raising will enable the Company to make investments towards significant expansion of 4G coverage, 5G network rollout and capacity expansion. These investments will enable the Company to improve its competitive positioning and offer an even better customer experience.

The telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. It needs a large capital infusion quickly to pay the government and large vendors like , expand its 4G coverage and roll out its pending 5G network to arrest heavy customer losses and compete effectively with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and .

The company continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking further by another 1.36 million to 223.05 million at the end of December. By contrast, market leader Jio added 3.99 million and Airtel gained 1.85 million users to end December with 459.81 million and 381.73 million subscribers, respectively.

Vi’s net debt widened to Rs 2.14 lakh-crore in the fiscal third quarter and cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that in the absence of headline rate increases, Vi would require around $8-10 billion (Rs 65,000-83,000 crore) of fresh capital over the next two years to have a comparable mobile broadband network to effectively compete with Airtel and Jio.

However, Vi’s dues to banks and other lenders have shrunk by Rs 7,140 crore to Rs 6,050 crore between Q3FY23 and Q3FY24. Existing debt payable by December 2024 is at Rs 5,385.4 crore, excluding amounts classified as current on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses.

Of this, around Rs 500 crore is toward spectrum principal-related payments, over Rs 3,200 toward bank dues and Rs 1660 crore toward repayment of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) issued to tower company, ATC India.

The telco’s leadership estimates that Vi’s annual payouts to the government would jump to around Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues.",The economic times
Ahead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-Street action on Wednesday,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:37:00 PM IST","Indian headline indices ended in the green on Tuesday, breaking their two-session losing streak. The gains were led by IT and auto stocks. While the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex closed the session at 73,095.22, up by 305 points or 0.42%, the broader Nifty ended at 22,198.35, gaining 76.30 points or 0.34%.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:


Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities said the trend remains positive as the index has consistently stayed above the near-term moving average. ""The Nifty has formed a bullish engulfing pattern after two days of weakness. Overall, the bulls may continue to exert control as the index has closed above the previous consolidation high. A decisive move above 22,200 might propel the index for a decent rally towards 22,400 in the near term. Support on the lower end is situated at 22,000,"" De said.




The Dow led lower on Tuesday as investors awaited a crucial inflation report and other economic data that would shape expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Market focus is back on the Fed's monetary policy path after a frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) in the previous week eclipsed concerns about delayed rate cuts and pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials to new peaks.

At 09:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.05 points, or 0.26%, at 38,967.18, the S&P 500 was down 2.79 points, or 0.06%, at 5,066.74, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.59 points, or 0.05%, at 15,967.67.


European shares edged slightly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in basic resources stocks and a string of upbeat earnings, while investors and central bankers braced for inflation data this week that could alter the course for interest rates.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ticked up 0.1% by 9:35 GMT, while Germany's benchmark DAX climbed 0.4%, logging another record high.

Investors are taking a pause after last week's surge in artificial intelligence-driven buying which propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high.


In a bustling session, Nifty closed around 22,200 defending the previous session's low at 22,075 and, prompted a rebound to regain the initial lost ground, said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One. The sentiment remained bullish throughout the day as intraday dips were met with buying interest, Bhosale added.

On the daily chart (excluding Thursday's candle), prices appear to be trading within a narrow range with 22,050-22,000 serving as a robust buying zone while 22,250-22,300 acted as a hurdle as traders seem to be awaiting a catalyst for a momentum shift, the Angel One analyst said.

In his view, the next significant movement will likely occur once this range of 22,000-22,300 is breached on a sustained closing basis.

Until then, his advice to traders is to pursue a buy-on-dip strategy ahead of the monthly expiry.


CMS Infosystems (Rs 1,684 crore), General Insurance (Rs 1,179 crore), Vodafone Idea (Rs 187 crore), IREDA (Rs 174 crore) were among the most active stocks on BSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.

Shares of , BEML, Tata Motors, , , Jamna Auto, KNR Construction and BSE were among the stocks that witnessed strong buying interest from market participants.


Over 300 stocks hit their 52-week highs on Tuesday while 20 stocks slipped to their 52-week lows. Among the ones which hit their 52-week highs included Adani Green, Bharat Electronics, CAMS, CIPLA, Data Patterns, DLF, Havells, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Inox Wind, and .

Ruling BJP kills two birds with one stone in Uttar Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:49:00 AM IST","Lucknow: BJP's strategy to bring SP MLAs to its side and garner the magic number for the victory of its eighth Rajya Sabha candidate also conceals a well-thought-out plan of strengthening itself in some weak Lok Sabha seats to which some MLAs belong, while giving a jolt to Samajwadi Party's morale ahead of the general elections.

At least seven SP MLAs are suspected to have cross-voted for BJP's candidates on Tuesday. The spadework for Tuesday likely began at least a fortnight ago, after which, assured of extra support, Sanjay Seth was brought in as the surprise eighth candidate by BJP. The party needed eight extra votes for Seth's win. Alarm bells first rang when eight SP MLAs skipped the dinner hosted by chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday and remained unreachable. On Tuesday morning, the first blow was dealt by SP MLA from Unchahar, Raebareli, Manoj Pandey, who resigned from the post of chief whip of the party before the voting commenced. Later, these MLAs were seen posing with deputy CM Brajesh Pathak confirming all doubts. Akhilesh Yadav declared that all who have cross-voted will be ousted from the party.

Observers say BJP has achieved two objectives. Not only will this deal a blow to SP, some MLAs, who have cross-voted and will likely be seen in BJP in the coming days, represent parts of Lok Sabha seats which BJP views as a challenge like Raebareli and Ambedkarnagar.

Apart from Raebareli Sadar assembly seat which is represented by BJP's Aditi Singh, all the remaining four assembly seats of the Raebareli LS constituency are occupied by SP, in what could have made it an uphill battle for BJP, coupled with the fact that it is a Congress bastion. Pandey's switchover, considering his credentials as a strong Brahmin face, will provide a significant boost to the party's prospects there and he may even be fielded as the BJP candidate from the seat, as is being speculated.

Top BJP leaders head to Bihar as Lok Sabha polls draw near,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:33:00 AM IST","New Delhi: Within a fortnight beginning Wednesday, BJP's top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, will address public meetings in Bihar as part of BJP-led NDA's aim to win all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The coalition, which won 39 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming for a clean sweep bolstered by JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar's return.

On March 2, Modi will address two public meetings in Aurangabad and Begusarai. This will be his first visit to Bihar after Kumar switched sides and rejoined NDA. Modi and Kumar will share the stage in Aurangabad after a long time.

Singh will visit Bihar on Wednesday. He will visit Sitamarhi and Darbhanga to address meetings. On Thursday, Shah will review poll preparedness and address a meeting of party workers near Patna.

The opposition camp too is planning a show of strength with a joint rally in Patna on March 3 in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to participate. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been touring the state as part of his Jan Vishwas Yatra, which will conclude on February 29.

"Shami undergoes ankle surgery, set to miss IPL","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:31:00 AM IST","Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami has undergone a successful surgery on his left achilles tendon, which rules him out of next month's Indian Premier League and possibly the T20 World Cup in June. The 33-year-old, who last played for India in the ODI World Cup final against Australia on November 19, went under the knife in London on Monday.

Shami, who is eager to ""get back on my feet soon"" stares at a recovery time of a minimum of three months.

He will thus miss the IPL slated to be played from March 22 to May 26, as reported by PTI last week.

Shami is also a doubtful starter for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.

""Just had a successful heel operation on my achilles tendon! Recovery is going to take some time, but looking forward to getting back on my feet,"" Shami tweeted, along with several pictures of him in the hospital, on X on Monday.

— MdShami11 (@MdShami11)

Shami, who was one of the architects of India's stupendous ODI World Cup campaign with 24 wickets, had played through pain as he had problems with his landing but didn't let it affect his performance.

He had flown to London in January to take special ankle injections. However, the medication didn't work and the fast bowler had to opt for surgery.

The absence of Shami is a major blow for Gujarat Titans, who have also traded all-rounder Hardik Pandya to Mumbai Indians in an all-cash deal. Shami was the side's highest wicket-taker during their runner-up finish in IPL last year.

Shami, who was recently conferred with the Arjuna Award, has 229 Test, 195 ODI and 24 T20 wickets in his decade-long career.

The development raises a question mark about the injury rehabilitation management programme planned by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for Shami.

It is also highly unlikely that the pacer would be able to make a comeback before India's Test matches at home against Bangladesh and New Zealand (October November).

His target could be the marquee away series against Australia.

Army called in amid fresh tension in Manipur; Assam Rifles deployed after senior cop abducted briefly,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:25:00 AM IST","The Army was called in as fresh tension mounted in Manipur on Tuesday and four columns of the Assam Rifles were deployed in Imphal East after a senior police officer was abducted allegedly by cadres of the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation, from his residence, officials said. The officer, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumar, posted in the operations wing of the Manipur Police, was rescued after a swift action by police and security forces, the officials said.

The officer has been admitted to a hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.

Giving details of the incident that took place around 7 pm on Tuesday, the officials said that a group of cadres owing allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol attacked the house of Kumar at Wangkhei in Imphal East.

The reason for this indiscriminate firing was that the officer concerned had arrested six members of the group for their alleged involvement in vehicle theft, the officials said.

Following the arrests, a group of Meira Paibis (Meitei women group) had protested and blocked roads demanding their release.

In the Tuesday evening attack, armed cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol ransacked the house and damaged at least four vehicles with gunfire, they said.

Detailing the chaotic events, M Kulla, the police officer's father, explained, ""We tried to talk to the armed men after they entered, but all of a sudden they started firing at the vehicles and properties. So we had to rush inside and lock ourselves.""

The father, according to the officials, called his son and informed about the incident.

The officer rushed with his team only to be abducted as they were outnumbered by the cadres allegedly belonging to the Arambai Tenggol.

The Manipur Police acted promptly, mobilising forces to launch a successful rescue operation, ensuring Kumar's safe return within hours.

The state government had to take help of the Army as the situation worded after the rescue efforts.

Officials said that four columns of the Assam Rifles were requisitioned and deployed around the area where the incident took place. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is not applicable in valley areas.

The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, functions under the operational command of the Army.

The region has witnessed escalating violence since May 3, with over 180 casualties reported after a ""Tribal Solidarity March"" in the hill districts protested the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.

The Meiteis, constituting around 53 per cent of Manipur's population and residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, contrast the tribals, including Nagas and Kukis, who make up 40 per cent and primarily inhabit the hill districts.

New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:58:00 PM IST","New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.

Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%.

The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.

Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.

""I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,"" Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.

The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.

Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.

""Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,"" said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

"Pizza, burger or chicken? Rs 80,000 crore question haunting investors in QSR stocks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 11:11:00 PM IST","As competition among quick service restaurants (QSRs) heats up, will the good old pizza lose out to other comfort foods like burger, fried chicken or biryani in the hunger game? This is an Rs 80,000 crore question for investors in 5 listed QSR stocks.

December quarter earnings showed flat sequential growth trends for QSRs as dine-in footfalls remained lower and demand dipped further during Diwali, which could be due to low disposable incomes (indebtedness/inflation), and shift of wallet spends to other categories like travel.

On a YoY basis, the sales growth was driven by an increase in store count despite SSSG (same store sales growth) and ADS (average daily sales) remaining under pressure across QSR categories.

In the pre-Covid era, pizza was the indisputable boss for western QSRs with Jubilant Foodworks (Domino's) being investor favourite. Now the trend is seen as shifting more towards burgers and fried chicken.

Jubilant has lost about 4% market share in India QSR space (19% in FY22 from 24% in FY17) while KFC's market share has increased after Covid, rising from 7% in FY19 to 10% in FY22, shows data from Elara Securities.

Due to high store count among pizza firms and increased competition, store growth expansion has slowed for these firms in the past few years. On the other hand, KFC is on an expansion spree and has been doubling down on store count.

""Chicken (KFC) is the only bright spot that saw 4.4% overall sequential pick-up (vs. muted trends for burger/pizza), and has seen an in-line growth vs. aggregators over the last two years,"" said Devanshu Bansal of Emkay Global.



QSR stocks have corrected 15-30% from recent 52-week highs, which is largely in-line with the cut in their respective earnings. Still, time correction cannot be ruled out due to lack of near-term triggers for Jubilant, Devyani and Westlife, he said.

The post-Covid era has worked unfavorably for pizza, analysts say, on account of competition and scale up in delivery offerings by aggregators like Zomato and Swiggy, which have increased variety (pizza was the only category which has 60% delivery revenue as on FY20).

""Fried chicken would continue to outperform pizza on new store expansion, and adoption of non-vegetarian food (~70% of Indians are non-vegetarian), which would drive better same store sales growth (SSSG) than peers,"" Elara's Karan Taurani said.

Who sells what?
Both Devyani and Sapphire have franchisees of KFC and Pizza Hut. Restaurant Brands Asia operates franchisees of Burger King in India & Indonesia and Popeyes in Indonesia. Westlife Foodworld runs McDonald's in western India and South India. Jubilant Food operates Domino's Pizza and Popeyes in India and a few other countries.

Together these 5 western QSR chains command a market capitalisation of about Rs 80,000 crore on Dalal Street. In the last 6 months, KFC-owned Sapphire is the only QSR stock to have given a decent return of 11%. Jubilant is flat while the remaining 3 stocks have given negative returns.

Which QSR stocks to buy?
Elara has buy ratings on Devyani, Sapphire with target prices of Rs 162 and Rs 1,401, respectively. It has told clients to accumulate Restaurant Brands Asia for a target price of Rs 130 and given reduce rating on Jubilant and Westlife.

Emkay prefers Sapphire with a relatively better SSG in KFC (~85% EBITDA mix), closing margin gap vs. peers, and valuation comfort (20-30% discount).

""Bloomberg consensus expects QSR companies to report 14-23% revenue CAGR and 21-44% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26 across companies, which still looks too optimistic to us. QSR stocks are trading at c72-103x P/E, based on FY25 Bloomberg consensus estimates,"" said Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas.

NCP leader Praful Patel resigns from Rajya Sabha ahead of fresh full term,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:47:00 PM IST","NCP leader Praful Patel on Tuesday resigned as a member of the Rajya Sabha after being re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament earlier this month.

Patel, who still had four years left in his fifth term, was fielded in the Rajya Sabha elections as he was facing a disqualification petition filed by the NCP's Sharad Pawar-led faction.

""Shri Praful Patel, an elected Member of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), representing the State of Maharashtra, resigned his seat in the Rajya Sabha and his resignation has been accepted by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, wef the 27th of February, 2024,"" a Rajya Sabha bulletin said on Tuesday, as per a PTI report.

Patel, who has aligned himself with Ajit Pawar in the NCP's factional fight, was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term in July 2022.

The NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar, the new name of the Sharad Pawar-led group, had filed a disqualification petition against Patel under Section 2(a) of the Tenth Schedule, which provides for disqualification on grounds of defection.

The acceptance of Patel's resignation from the Rajya Sabha will pave the way for him to start a fresh term in the Upper House in place of Vandana Chavan, who completes her tenure in April.

Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar, walked out of the NCP with a majority of party MLAs last July and was sworn in as a deputy chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Recently, the Election Commission recognised the Ajit Pawar group as the real NCP and allotted the party's 'clock' election symbol to it.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar has also recognised the Ajit Pawar-led group as the real NCP.

The Election Commission will now have to call for a bypoll to fill the vacancy created by Patel's resignation.

BJP wins eight Rajya Sabha seats; SP bags two seats in UP,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 10:04:00 PM IST","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday won eight, out of ten, Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, SP bagged two seats in the state.

Voting in the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh began around 9 am on Tuesday. The BJP had fielded eight candidates and the Samajwadi Party (SP) three.

The ruling BJP and the principal opposition SP had the numbers to send seven and three members respectively unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, but with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, a keen contest was on the cards in one of the seats.

The BJP and the SP are the two largest parties in the 403-member state assembly with 252 MLAs and 108 MLAs respectively. The Congress, an alliance partner of the SP, has two seats.

BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has 13 seats, the NISHAD Party has six seats, RLD has nine seats, SBSP six, Jansatta Dal Loktantrik two and the BSP has one seat. Four seats are currently vacant.

The seven other candidates fielded by the BJP were former Union minister RPN Singh, former MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, general secretary of the party's Uttar Pradesh unit Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant (Bind), party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain.

The Samajwadi Party had fielded actor-MP Jaya Bachchan, retired IAS officer Alok Ranjan and Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman.

To get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, a candidate needs nearly 37 first-preference votes.

""Polling will be held from 9 am to 4 pm. Counting will commence from 5 pm and results are likely to be announced on Tuesday night,"" Dubey had earlier said.

Court asks police to arrest Jaya Prada and produce her before it on March 6,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:49:00 PM IST","Actor and former MP Jaya Prada was labelled an ""absconder"" by a Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, court on Tuesday in relation to two charges of election code violations. The police were instructed to apprehend Prada and bring her before the court on March 6.

According to senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari, two cases were registered against the former MP from Rampur at Kemari and Swar police stations for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 polls and was defeated by Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The SP expelled her subsequently.

In these cases, the special MP-MLA court had issued summons several times but the former MP did not appear before it.

Subsequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her seven times, but the police could not produce her before the court.

He said that the police, in its reply filed in the court, said that Jaya Prada was evading arrest and all her known mobile numbers were switched off.

Tiwari said that on this, judge Shobhit Bansal took a tough stance and declared Jaya Prada as an absconder.

The Superintendent of Police of Rampur was ordered to form a team under the leadership of a circle officer and arrest Jaya Prada and produce her in the court on the next date of hearing on March 6.

BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan wins lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:21:00 PM IST","BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday won the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh after a lot of suspense over the seat.

An official announcement by the Election Commission on the poll results is yet to be made

""I congratulate PM Modi because here, in Himachal Pradesh, where we are not in power, the BJP has won one Rajya Sabha seat and the credit goes to JP Nadda and Amit Shah,"" said Himachal Pradesh LoP Jairam Thakur on Rajya Sabha election results.

Polling for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh, which began at 9 am on Tuesday, ended with Congress MLA from Chintpurni Sudershan Babloo casting the last vote. The polling was brisk and all 68 members have voted. Independent MLA from Hamipur Ashish was the first to cast his vote.

Congress MLA Babloo was brought to the Assembly in a helicopter as he was unwell.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu after casting his vote said the MLAs have voted as per the ideology of the party.

""We have 40 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha and unless MLAs are bought off, we will get all the votes,"" PTI quoted him as saying.

Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said that it was the democratic right of the MLAs to vote and it was not necessary that the candidate be elected unopposed.

""We have fielded the candidate gauging the situation and hope that all MLAs would exercise their conscious vote,"" he added.

The BJP had fielded Harsh Mahajan against Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Mahajan, a three-time Congress MLA and former minister, had resigned from the party in September 2022 ahead of the assembly polls and joined the BJP.

The Congress had issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for Singhvi following which the BJP had accused the ruling Congress of issuing whip to their members to pressurise them and maintained that the MLAs have been elected democratically and have the right to vote as per their wish.

The BJP candidate had sent a complaint to the chief election commissioner drawing his attention to the three line whip issued by the Congress to vote for the party candidate.

In his complaint, Mahajan said that such a whip is not only unethical but also against the conducting of elections to the Rajya Sabha as it will affect the decision making ability of the MLAs.

"Rajya Sabha Elections: ""CRPF, Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 Congress MLAs,"" Himachal CM Sukhvinder Sukhu","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:37:00 PM IST","As counting for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh is underway, state Chief Minister Sukhvinder Sukhu on Tuesday alleged that CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away five to six Congress MLAs and urged the Himachal BJP leaders to have patience and not to threaten polling officers.

""The manner in which the counting has begun and Opposition leaders are threatening the polling officers again and again is not right for democracy...They had halted the counting for long. I urge the Himachal BJP unit leaders to have patience, don't put pressure on people...CRPF and Haryana Police convoy have taken away 5-6 MLAs,"" CM Sukhu told reporters on Tuesday.

He further said that, ""I can say that the people who have gone away are being contacted by their families, I urge them to contact their families...There is no need to worry.""

67 out of the total 68 legislators exercised their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Sudarshan Singh Babloo, Congress MLA, has not come so far due to illness. He was hospitalised.

There is fierce competition in Himachal Pradesh for the sole Rajya Sabha seat between Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and the BJP's Harsh Mahajan.

Notably, the Congress has a clear majority with 40 out of 68 MLAs and the support of three independent MLAs. Despite the fact that the BJP, with 25 MLAs, is far behind in the number game, it has forced a contest by fielding Mahajan against Singhvi.

Earlier on Sunday, the Congress issued a whip to its MLAs to vote for party candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

Following the whip, all the candidates will have to show the ballot to the authorised agent, who can declare a vote invalid if any MLA refuses to show the ballot.

Voting for 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, were being held on Tuesday.

The term for Rajya Sabha MPs is six years, and elections are held after every two years for 33 per cent of the seats. Currently, the Rajya Sabha has a strength of 245 members.

The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by the MLAs in an indirect election through the system of proportional representation. They are mostly foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through.

Will India's pharma sector be able to come out of its China dependence?,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 07:19:00 PM IST","In its more than 120-year-history, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has dodged a gamut of bullets, in the sense that it has evolved and established itself to rank as the third largest producer of pharma products by volume and 14th by value. Nonetheless, there’s still some space to do better and there are challenges which continue to persist.

While it boasts to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines, nearly half of the world’s, Indian-made drugs account for around 40 per cent of generics in the US and a quarter in the U.K. But the subcontinent’s heavy dependence on imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), key starting materials (KSM) and basic chemicals has been rather alarming, highlighting the need for a resolution.

It was only on February 24, 2021, when the government introduced the Product-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to push the ‘Atmanirbhar’ narrative in the pharma sector. With an outlay of Rs 15,000 crore for a duration of 2020-2021 to 2028-29, the government aims to enhance the estimated $65 billion industry’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector.

However, in the latest, ET has learnt that the Centre is mulling tweaks in the existing PLI scheme in various well-performing sectors including the pharmaceutical, more like “a course correction to attract more investment"". Further, there are media reports doing rounds, which claim a new PLI scheme is in the pipeline for APIs and KSMs to deal with the problem of extensive imports. This new scheme may include basic chemicals under its scope, in an attempt to cover the entire supply chain.

The PLI pill for pharma sector
The main objective behind the PLI scheme was to push local manufacturing through incentives. As of September 2023, investments worth Rs 25,813 crore have been made and 56,171 new jobs were added under the manufacturing scheme for pharmaceuticals. Further, the sales made by the selected applicants, as per government, is worth Rs 1,16,121 crore, which includes exports of Rs 75,141 crore.

Applications from industry players across all categories namely, KSMs, drug intermediates (DIs) and APIs were invited. Notably, the government had outlaid Rs 6,940 crore for these and will provide financial incentives for selected participants on incremental sales of 41 identified products in four different target segments for a period of six years.

A total of 249 applications across all above-mentioned categories were received, out of which 48 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 3,938.57 crore and expected employment generation of around 9,618 persons.

Out of 48 approved projects, as of September last year, 27 projects have been commissioned. As per the government, investment of Rs 3,063 crore has been grounded and employment for 2,777 persons has been generated, with sales worth Rs 817.33 crore, including exports of Rs 252.62 crore.

A similar tale of progress is seen under the PLI scheme for medical devices which has a financial outlay of Rs 3,420 crore. Under this, a total 64 applications across four categories of products were received and 26 applications have been approved with committed investment of Rs 1,330.44 crore and expected employment generation for around 7,950 persons.

Nearly 16 of the 26 approved projects have been commissioned and manufacturing of 39 medical devices has commenced with investment of Rs 879 crore grounded and employment generated for 4,546 persons.

Furthermore, the government has built three bulk drug parks with a total cost outlay of Rs 3000 crore.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative for APIs and KSMs, to an extent, did get the push it needed via PLIs but has just this been enough? It would only be fair to highlight that imports of the bulk drugs have witnessed a steady CAGR of about 7 per cent, according to a CareEdge report, reflecting the industry’s reliance on these essential components.

PLI has not cured the Chinese import problem
It might shock you but the fact is India depends on China for APIs, or the required raw materials, even for paracetamol, a common antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug.

Consider this: India’s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. gets about 55% of its raw materials for ingredients from China, as per a Bloomberg report. Aurobindo supplies the most generic drugs by volume to the US, and its $3.1 billion in 2023 revenue was second-highest among Indian drugmakers.

Significant growth in terms of bulk drug imports from China has been recorded in both value and volume terms, which increased from 64 per cent and 62 per cent during FY14 to 71 per cent and 75 per cent during FY23, respectively. Meanwhile, India's 43 per cent of total pharma imports are from China.

Adding to the already sore spot, India's dependency on KSM from Beijing exceeds 50 per cent.

Given the pace of the sector’s growth, it is all set to lead to gradual requirements for APIs, according to the CareEdge report and as a result, the overall dependency on the import of bulk drugs from China is likely to continue to be high.

Pushing it further
While China and its cheap raw material is a thorn in India’s Atmanirbharta push, and the fact that Beijing supply disruptions volatility is always a threat, the government may look to add to the supply chain ecosystem with the PLI scheme. The need to bring down the cost of APIs is of utmost importance because manufacturers, who are not the beneficiaries of the existing PLI, are able to supply these essentials at a cheaper price with imports.

Further, the plan to introduce a PLI scheme for basic chemicals may also take shape.

In September, Fertlisers and Chemical Minister had noted, ""If we support basic chemicals, then agrochemicals and pharma chemicals, all types of chemicals will become cheaper to make. So, in a short time, we are coming up with a PLI scheme for basic chemicals. It will be useful to promote the chemical sector.""

""To produce API, we need basic chemicals. So we got suggestions to bring PLI for basic chemicals itself,"" the Minister said, adding that this will lead to affordability and help in becoming self-reliant.

If media reports, which claim a new PLI scheme in pipelines for APIs and KSMs to deal with the China problem, do turn out to be true, it will be another major boost for the thriving sector and also align itself with the Modi-led government's dream of being able to export these raw materials in the next one decade.

Boasting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 9.43 per cent since the past nine years, the industry is all set to grow by approximately 7 to 9 per cent in FY24 and FY25. On the revenue front for this fiscal, as per a CRISIL report, the pharma industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent, all thanks to steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds.

"Rajya Sabha Polls: Congress wins three seats, BJP bags one in Karnataka","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:24:00 PM IST","In a closely contested electoral battle in Karnataka, all three Congress candidates emerged victorious. The three candidates- Ajay Maken, Dr. Syed Naseer Hussain, and GC Chandrashekhar- secured wins with slender margins, receiving 47, 46, and 46 votes respectively.

Voting in the elections for the four Rajya Sabha seats in Karnataka began Tuesday at 9 am. The counting began at 5pm.

The Congress had 133 MLAs, the BJP has 66, JD (S) 19, while others account for four.

Of the four others, the Congress claimed the support of two independents and Darshan Puttanaiah from Sarvodaya Karnataka Paksha, and was confident of winning three seats. Interestingly, the fourth one - G Janardhana Reddy (of Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha) met the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday.

The Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant following the retirement of four members - Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP and G C Chandrashekhar, Syed Naseer Hussain and L Hanumanthaiah from the Congress.

The Congress, which was confident of winning three seats had fielded G C Chandrashekhar, Naseer Hussain and former union minister Ajay Maken.

The BJP had fielded Narayansa Bhandage as also JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy as the NDA candidate which had made the election interesting.

Congress sources claimed that the party has the support of four others, reported PTI.

""Besides, we may get three votes from the rival camp,"" a top Congress source told PTI.

Fearing cross-voting, the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance huddled their MLAs in a private resort on Monday.

They also conducted a workshop for the new members to inform them about the election process and how to cast their votes.

All parties have issued whips to the MLAs, who are the voters in Tuesday's poll, amid apprehensions of cross-voting.

According to official sources, each candidate has to get 45 votes to win, if there are only four candidates in the fray, but in the case of more candidates, the preference votes kick in.

"Platinum Industries CMD on IPO, sustaining financials, and ambitious expansion plans","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:58:00 PM IST","The initial public offer (IPO) Platinum Industries opened for subscription on Tuesday and was lapped up by investors within no time. In an interaction with ET Markets, Platinum Industries Chairman Krishna Dushyant Rana talks about the IPO in current market conditions, sustaining strong financial growth, strategic expansion and the vision for the company over the next few years.
Edited Excerpts

Firstly, how excited or nervous are you about the IPO. Are you confident that it will sit well with investors in the current market conditions?
The anticipation of Platinum Industries' IPO certainly brings a mix of eagerness and excitement, but above all, there's a strong confidence in its success. We have meticulously analyzed the market conditions and believe that our solid growth trajectory, commitment to innovation, and sustainability make us an attractive proposition for investors. We are optimistic about the reception from the investment community.


Yes. In response to the evolving demands of both the domestic and international markets, Platinum Industries is embarking on an ambitious global expansion plan. We are in the process of setting up two new to significantly bolster our production capacity and product offerings.

The first facility, located in Egypt, is strategically positioned to serve as a hub for our international market operations while also catering to the local Egyptian market. This expansion is not just about increasing our geographical footprint; it is about bringing our high-quality products closer to our customers globally, enhancing our supply chain efficiency, and tapping into new growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.

Simultaneously, we are also planning to launch a greenfield project in Palghar, close to our existing facility focused on the production of lead-free stabilizers and associated products. This move is in line with our commitment to sustainability and innovation, ensuring that we not only meet but exceed environmental standards. The new facility in Palghar plant represents our dedication to pioneering safer, eco-friendly alternatives in the industry.

Both these projects are pivotal to our growth strategy, enabling us to meet the increasing demand, diversify our , and solidify our commitment to sustainability. These expansions reflect our proactive approach to addressing market needs and our vision for a sustainable future in manufacturing.


: Our financial performance from FY20-23 is a testament to Platinum Industries’ strategic foresight and operational excellence.

To sustain and build upon these numbers, we are adopting a multi-faceted strategy. Firstly, we are doubling down on innovation. Our R&D efforts are geared towards developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands, ensuring we stay ahead of industry trends.

Secondly, operational efficiency is key. We are investing in cutting-edge technology and optimizing our processes to reduce costs and improve margins.

Furthermore, market expansion plays a critical role. We are not just focusing on expanding our product portfolio but also on penetrating new markets both domestically and internationally. The establishment of new manufacturing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Palghar, Maharashtra is a strategic move towards this goal, enabling us to cater to a broader customer base and diversify our revenue
streams.

Lastly, customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our operations. By maintaining high-quality standards and delivering value to our customers, we aim to strengthen our market position and foster long-term relationships. This comprehensive approach underpins our confidence in sustaining our growth momentum and continuing to deliver value to our stakeholders.


Platinum Industries was born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of the PVC industry in India. With a focus on innovation, the company has established itself as a vital player in the production of essential components that cater to a diverse range of applications. Our product portfolio includes high-quality additives for PVC pipes, profiles, fittings, as well as for the manufacturing of electrical wires, cables, SPC floor tiles, rigid PVC foam boards, and packaging materials.

The development of lead-free stabilizers further underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship and health safety. Our products are designed to enhance the performance, durability, and safety of PVC applications, setting new standards in the industry.


: A significant portion of the IPO proceeds is designated for the capital expenditure requirements of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for in Palghar, Maharashtra. This facility is not just an expansion of our physical footprint; it's a leap towards enhancing our production capabilities and product portfolio, especially focusing on lead-free stabilizers and associated products

Additionally, we are channelling strategic investments into our subsidiary, Platinum Stabilizers Egypt, located in the SC Zone, Egypt. This investment reflects our global ambitions and is pivotal in positioning Platinum Industries as a key player in the international market.

The Egyptian facility will serve both local and international markets, facilitating our entry into Middle Eastern and African markets, thus diversifying our customer base.

The remaining proceeds will bolster our working capital requirements, ensuring operational fluidity and the ability to swiftly respond to market demands. This strategy is designed to sustain our growth trajectory, support our expansion plans, and enhance .


As Platinum Industries embarks on its journey to expand its global footprint, we are strategically positioning ourselves to meet the increasing international demand for PVC stabilizers. Egypt stands out as one of the largest consumers of PVC stabilizers in the African continent, yet it lacks local manufacturers for these critical components. This presents a unique opportunity for Platinum Industries to fill a significant market gap and become a pioneer not just in this region but also cater to a wider geography. The growing demand for stabilizers in North Africa and the Middle East positions Egypt as a strategic hub, and with the establishment of our new manufacturing facility in this region we will not only be able to amplify our production capabilities but also to solidify our presence on the global stage. It's a strategic move that will enable us to enhance our supply chain efficiencies, reduce logistical costs, and provide timely and competitive products to these rapidly growing markets.


Looking ahead, my vision for Platinum Industries over the next decade is to establish ourselves as global leaders in the PVC stabilizers and additives market. We aim to expand our footprint across new geographies, particularly focusing on markets with growing demand for sustainable PVC solutions. By continuously investing in technology and innovation, we aspire to drive the industry towards more environmentally responsible practices. Ultimately, Platinum Industries seeks to not just respond to the market but to shape its future, creating value for our customers, stakeholders, and the planet.",The economic times

8-10% correction likely in Nifty as well as broader markets: Amit Khurana,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:25:00 PM IST","Amit Khurana, Head of Equities, Dolat Capital, says “we believe a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and on any dips, we intend to add to the positions. At this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.”

What is your take on the PSU pack? Even from the top, we have not seen much of a fall come by even after today's fall in the Nifty PSE or for that matter in some of the individual names too.
Amit Khurana: Yes, that is true. The kind of performance that we have seen from the PSU pack has been quite stupendous to say the least and we have also been sort of surprised. I think the re-rating has been so stark in some of the sectors. But when you look at it objectively from here onwards, most of these names across sectors, capture a fair amount of optimism, a fair amount of earnings and valuation re-rating.

In particular, PSU banks are something that we have downgraded today. We believe that most of the rally, especially in midcap PSUs, ex-SBI, was largely led by the earnings which were led by recoveries, very muted credit costs, which we believe has a very high probability of going to mean reversion. So, the credit costs mean reverting for 2025 and 2026 will imply much lower earnings growth.

Most of these PSU banks now trade at one time plus price to book which we believe is fair. So, we have downgraded PSU banks as a space. Some of these franchises also have very low buffers for any system level shocks. While we are not building that as a base case, but any eventualities that may work out over the next 12 to 18 months, some of these banks are not adequately provisioned for on their P&L.

Therefore the risks are elevated as we call it. But then, there are other pockets of the PSU universe where we still believe there is value. For example, city gas distribution companies are in a much better situation and we believe the market is underestimating the volume uptake that some of these franchises will show. So, it is a very stock specific view that we are taking. But in general, the re-rating has been fairly rich and therefore one needs to be more cautious.

Any view on Shriram Finance?
Amit Khurana: We have been bullish on the stock. The reaction today is more on the inclusion in the Nifty. There is a lot of versions going around the Street. I would probably refrain from giving a view from that perspective. But fundamentally, we have been more bullish on Shriram Finance than some of the other CV financers.

But separately, what is the view on Vodafone-Idea and the telecom sector as a whole? The fund infusion is being talked about. Would it be material enough to change the fate of the company?
Amit Khurana: That is right. We do not have a rating on Vodafone, but from a telecom sector perspective, I think this is one name which has had very serious structural challenges. The management has been pretty committed, and, of course, then the government support came in. So, we have been backing up Bharti, which still remains our preferred pick on the sector. The level of the fund infusion and, of course, the time that it will require for this franchise to turn around is considerably longer and therefore, we have been sort of keeping it on the sidelines. So, Bharti is what we played on the telecom side.

What are your positive biases in the market right now, sectorally?
They have not changed really much. We are still bullish on some of the discretionary consumption categories, in particular real estate, where we believe that the demand traction is extremely strong and largely consumption led demand, so that has its own sort of ramification. We have been bullish on cement, except for the caveat that the near-term valuations look pretty stretched and I think the market has been pretty optimistic on volume numbers, whereas we have been slightly, shall I say, more conservative.

But even then, this sector remains one of our favourites to add to our positions on every dip for that matter. On banks, we have been very bullish, but I think the markets just seem to keep derating the franchises because of concerns on NIMs and this entire higher interest rate regime, which earlier we thought will possibly start unwinding from June onwards, but the latest policy from the MPC seems to suggest it more moving towards August as the first rate cut scenario and therefore the concerns on banking names continues to play out on the negative side, but we believe that the sector is in pretty reasonable attractive valuations, especially the frontline largecap banks.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
When I said earlier, it was more on the PSU banks where we feel the valuations are a little on the higher side, but on the frontline private sector banks, we remain extremely bullish. And then, some of the other sectors show some initial signs of bottoming out, but we have not yet upgraded them, we are still neutral. But chemicals is one space where we believe the inventory corrections, the pricing corrections are very much captured and hopefully over the next quarter or two, we will start seeing better evidence to upgrade the sector at large. But now we are still neutral.

Within the insurance pack, do you like anything? Whether the general insurance or the life insurance because whether it is HDFC Life, whether it is ICICI Pru, ICICI Lombard, they are all seeing quite a bit of up move today and LIC too had finally reached that four-digit mark.
Amit Khurana: We do not have formal ratings on these stocks. We do not cover insurance formally, but there has been some news flow which has been sort of suggestive of a government taking proactive measures to increase insurance penetration. So, we have seen some level of client-level interest, but officially we do not have a stance on any of these franchises.

What is the view on the IT sector? Do you think the note that came this morning from UBS talking about how TCS can actually lead versus the peers has some credence?
Amit Khurana: Yes, we have been sort of debating this internally as well. We are still neutral. IT was another candidate which we were looking to do a potential upgrade. But our take is that the evidence does not still point towards a potential for an upgrade. But I must make a distinction here. We believe that the largecaps are in a much better position. In fact, our view on midcap IT still continues to be negative, considering that the PEG multiples are closer to 2.4, 2.5. In some cases, even three times.

We have been wary of midcaps in particular. But largecaps, at a certain price point, will be an interesting one to look out, especially considering that they have underperformed and largely the narrative has been captured to whatever extent the concerns were. But at this stage, we are still neutral. Rather than playing the IT, we are playing more on the digital themes, some of these names which are more domestic stories so to say on the B2B side or on the digital side.

Bank Nifty is way weaker than Nifty; positive on realty & pharma sectors: Meghana Malkan
What is it that you are making of the ongoings at Paytm right now? Vijay Shekhar Sharma resigning as part-time non-executive chairman at the PPBL board, so sort of clearly giving an indication that he has not got all his claws into the company anymore and if need be, he is willing to step down.
Amit Khurana: Yes, these are developments that we have been watching very closely. Paytm was one of the stocks which was in our preferred-picks universe, but we took it out this quarter. There were two reasons for that. One, the level of uncertainty on the regulatory front now raises the risk element for the entire franchise significantly. So, therefore, we took it out.

And then, of course, these developments will probably have a bearing as to how the investors perceive Paytm as a business model, and the entire management initiative to make sure that the growth sustains on the other parts of the business. There are some other developments which are also likely to come in the public domain as per the management guidance, which will give a sense as to how the move to the third-party banks will work out and that will be an important development from our perspective also because if the transition works out seamlessly over the next few months, then the confidence may return to the company and therefore, the risk premia that the market is today demanding on this as a franchise may sort of normalise.

But at this stage, the regulatory overhang will continue to sort of keep the performance a little capped and as we go along, one will have to revisit the entire hypothesis. We have yet maintained our buy on the stock, but the preferred picks universe, it is out of that, that is a clear mention I want to make.

Whirlpool aside, which of course has now sort of risen up from the session lows, where is it that you are seeing valuation peak within the market?
Amit Khurana: Well, it seems to be across the board, I must say that. In fact, you see the PSU pack, which we have discussed earlier. You see some of the midcap companies, whether it is domestic consumption, whether it is hotels for that matter, retail or jewellery. Of course, footwear has not done so well, so they seem to be at the bottom rung of the entire curve, but their earnings are not supportive. It is very difficult to decipher beyond a level because this market keeps buying into dips.

My sense is this, that in the Nifty, you will possibly look out for a double-digit correction, that has been our call which we published today in the strategy piece. We believe that a broader correction of up to double digits on the Nifty should be par for the taking and within that, you will see some of the sectors probably correcting more. Banks seem to have largely corrected. Consumption, domestic staples in particular seems to have largely corrected. But some of the other categories which have done absolutely well, for example, hotels or for that matter jewellery, some of those discretionary consumption stocks, autos have done pretty well. So, those could possibly have a higher level of correction and any dips. We intend to add to the positions. But at this time, some of these categories look pretty richly valued.

Are you saying that there could be a double-digit correction in certain pockets of midcap and smallcap?
Amit Khurana: That is right and at the Nifty as well, we called it out today.

Oh, double-digit correction in Nifty as well, that is quite stark. So, you are expecting that it could go below 20,000 at some point of time.
Amit Khurana: The point we are trying to make is that 8% to 10% correction is a par for the course. Also, look at it in the context that in the last 12 months Nifty has done a fabulous run. We have gone up by almost 25-27% returns on the indices, larger indices in the last few months. So, 8-10% correction is par for the course and that will make the entry levels pretty attractive and some of the individual stocks attractive enough.

Remember, we are still quoting at a significant premium to the long-period averages. Now, a long-period average, all these things have come into play on expectations of a third term for the Modi government, continuation of the PSU cycle, the rerating cycle which is continuing right now, and a whole lot of other positive optimism captured and a large part of that was also the fact that the interest rate cuts would start sooner than later.

All those factors have been largely captured and there are now situations where one may build in a scenario of a rate cut happening not in May or June, but possibly in August. So, all those revisitings of those hypotheses will play out and possibly trigger a 8-10% correction.

GIFT City taps RBI for RTGS-like dollar payment system,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 09:26:00 PM IST","MUMBAI: Officials from the GIFT City have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for consultations in setting up a dollar payment system mechanism that aims to bring about greater efficiency in transactions conducted in the US currency, sources aware of the developments told ET.

""There are initial discussions about this matter because at present when a dollar transaction happens from one bank's nostro account abroad, it takes several hours for a subsidiary in GIFT City to receive the dollars,"" one of the sources said.

A potentially new dollar payment system could be akin to the existing Real-Time Gross Settlement System (), said the source.

A nostro account refers to an account held abroad by a local bank, with currency holdings denominated in the currency of the foreign country.


Among the proposals currently being discussed was the establishment of a single 'settlement bank' in GIFT City, with which other entities would have dollar balances. Subsequently, debits and credits would be conducted through the settlement bank, sources said.

Emails sent to the RBI and the GIFT City seeking comment on the matter did not receive responses by the time of publication.

""Chances are that the would be called upon to operate as a facilitator for an RTGS-type model because they have expertise in handling such operations,"" another source said.

""There would be no counterparty guarantee or trades - the CCIL would basically act as a payment system for a one-leg US dollar transaction,"" the source said.

In June 2023, the RBI permitted banks operating in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to offer non-deliverable derivatives contracts utilising rupees to resident non-retail users for hedging.

Family of deceased housewife wins Rs 6 lakh in SC; homemaking not a valid ground for low payout to accident victim,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:34:00 PM IST","Losing a homemaker could be a big traumatic experience for any family. However, when it comes to calculating the financial loss for awarding compensation, the contribution of a housewife is often underestimated. The recent judgement by the Supreme Court gives the much-needed financial dignity to the duties performed by a housewife. When the mother of two children died in a motor accident in 2006, her husband and two children, who were students at that time, demanded compensation for such a big loss to their family. However, they were offered only a meagre sum of Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT). The family found the compensation was very low and hence they rejected it and decided to file an appeal against it in the high court.

However, the proceedings were not easy for them as they suffered a setback as the high court rejected their appeal. Despite the odds, the family went on to escalate the fight to the Supreme Court where they finally got a favourable order. The court increased the compensation by Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in total. The Supreme Court observed that a lower compensation is not justified just because the deceased was a homemaker.

Why did the family have to approach the court for compensation?
Sushma Pandey, a 50-year-old homemaker, died when her car lost control, skidded off, and fell into a ditch on June 26, 2006. She left behind her husband and two children who were still studying at that time. Although this is a sad incident, what's even more sad is the fact that the vehicle did not have valid insurance at that time, so the insurance company was not liable to pay any money.

Why did the family initially get Rs 2.5 lakh as compensation?
Initially, the family approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MCAT) for compensation of Rs 16.85 lakh but that was dismissed. Then, the family approached the high court, and the high court asked the tribunal to again hear the case. In this second hearing, the tribunal deemed that the family should get Rs 2.5 lakh compensation and hence ordered the same. Rejecting this compensation, the husband of the deceased homemaker filed an appeal in the high court. Later that appeal was dismissed by the court.

Supreme Court does justice by passing a favourable order
When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the apex court ruled in favour of the family and also underlined the importance of a homemaker in a family. In its judgement, the apex court opined that the contribution of a housewife cannot be measured in tangible income terms. ""The activities performed by a homemaker, if counted one by one, there will hardly be any doubt that the contribution of a homemaker is of a high order and invaluable. In fact, it is difficult to assess such a contribution in monetary terms. We are constrained to observe that the impugned order passed by the High Court is full of factual as well as legal errors,"" said the Supreme Court in an order dated February 16, 2024.

The Supreme Court further criticised the high court
""The High Court misread the facts while observing that the deceased was travelling in the bus, while actually, she was travelling in the car. Similarly, the High Court has committed a patent error in observing that the appellants are not dependent on the deceased. The High Court overlooked the fact that the deceased was about 50 years old and not 55 years old,"" said the Supreme Court.

How did the Supreme Court calculate the compensation amount
Although the Supreme Court admitted that calculating the monetary value of a homemaker is highly difficult, the reference wages of a daily wage worker were taken for determining the compensation.

""Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, it appears to us that the monthly income of the deceased, at the relevant time, could not be less than Rs.4,000/- p.m. or so. However, instead of calculating the compensation under different heads, and also keeping in mind the fact that the appellants and the respondents are closely related, and the delinquent vehicle was not insured, we deem it appropriate to allow this appeal in part to the extent that the appellants are granted a lump sum compensation of Rs 6,00,000/- (Rupees six lakhs),"" said the Supreme Court in the order.

""One of the major reasons for the compensation being granted by the Supreme Court is due to the finding that the contribution of a homemaker is invaluable, and her direct/indirect income could not be less than the wages admissible to a daily wager in the State of Uttarakhand under the Minimum Wages Act. The factual error of not recognizing the appellants to be dependent on their deceased mother also impacted the computation of the compensation awarded,"" says Ankur Mahindro, Managing Partner, Kred Jure, a law firm.",The economic times
"Sebi asks small, mid-cap funds to disclose more about risks","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 02:19:00 PM IST","India's market regulator has asked the country's asset managers to give investors more information about the risks associated with their small and mid-cap funds, according to a fund manager and two people with knowledge of the matter.

Small and mid-sized funds have seen high inflows, causing concern among authorities about how they would hold up in the event of a sharp market selloff. The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also been reviewing stress tests conducted by such funds, sources have previously said.

The funds are being asked to disclose how long it might take to accommodate large redemptions, what impact large outflows could have on the value of the portfolio and how much cash and liquid assets the fund holds to meet outflows, the people said.

""Investment committees were always aware of liquidity challenges but investors were not. Once this information is available to them, they can compare each fund,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mutual Fund.

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), which is working with SEBI, is proposing a standardised format for the disclosure of risks, he added.

SEBI and AMFI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Heavy inflows have sent the Nifty small cap 250 index surging 71% over the past 52 months and lifted the Nifty mid cap 100 index 64%. That far exceeds the benchmark Nifty's 28% rise.

Funds are likely to begin making these disclosures from April, said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.

Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.

""In some cases, the funds do not have enough cash. While in others, funds are fully invested in small/midcap stocks with no prudent investments in large-cap stocks,"" said the second source.

In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion and 200 billion rupees.

Kotak, which manages a 144 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) small-cap fund, has put temporary restrictions on inflows, saying that ""momentum chasing"" is ""over-shadowing the caution required"".

Last year, Tata Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund stopped accepting lumpsum investments in their small-cap funds.

Railways cuts ticket prices for passenger trains by 50%: Here are details,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","In a big relief to railway passengers, the Railways has announced a reduction in ticket prices to pre-covid levels. This move aims to provide financial relief to daily commuters, with prices for passenger trains dropping by approximately 40-50 per cent. Previously, passengers had to pay the express fare for passenger train travel.

Ticket prices reduced for Passenger trains, MEMU
The Indian Railways reinstated Second Class Ordinary Fares on 'Passenger Trains,' now designated as 'Express Specials' or 'MEMU/DEMU Express' Trains, effective February 27. Following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Railways phased out 'Passenger Trains' and elevated the minimum ticket price from Rs 10 to Rs 30, aligning it with Express Train fares. Railway authorities notified Chief Booking Reservation Supervisors of the reversal, effective Tuesday morning.

Railway authorities decreased Ordinary Class fares by approximately 50% on all Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains and those designated with numbers starting with ‘Zero’. Additionally, revisions were made to the fare structure in the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) App. This fare reduction applies to all trains previously categorized as Passenger Trains and now operating as ‘Express Special’ or MEMU trains nationwide.

Shivnath Biyani, a member of the Central Railway Passenger Advisory Committee, told TOI that ticket prices for several destinations have been reduced to half the previous rates. This reduction came into effect on Thursday.

Rail Ticket fares were increased due to Covid
Passenger trains were cancelled four years ago to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic. When they were reintroduced, passengers had to pay the express fare for their travel. Biyani mentioned that representatives and passenger associations consistently demanded a reduction in prices.

Passengers expressed their satisfaction with the price reduction.

"NPS investment can save you tax on income up to Rs 9.5 lakh under old, new tax regime: Here's how","Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 01:09:00 PM IST","Many people invest in the National Pension System (NPS) to save for retirement. The additional advantage of NPS is that it offers tax benefits in the old as well as new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, NPS offers tax benefits under three sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here is a look at how investing in NPS can help you save tax in old and new tax regimes under various sections of the Income Tax Act.

NPS investment under new tax regime

Individuals opting for the new tax regime in the current financial year can get a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act by investing in NPS. This deduction from gross total income can be claimed if the employer makes a contribution to NPS account on behalf of the employee. Here, the employer deposits money into the Tier-I NPS account of the employee. These NPS contributions are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC) and so impact the take-home pay.

Also Read: 15 income tax changes that will impact you in 2024

Of such deposits (i.e. made by the employer) an employee can claim an amount up to 10% of their salary as the deduction. A government (central and state government) employee can claim up to 14% of his/her salary as deduction for the NPS contribution made by the government.

Salary is defined as basic salary plus dearness allowance. No other component (such as house rent allowance, special allowance, etc.) is taken into account as salary for calculating the eligible deduction amount.

There is another limit on how much of an employer's contribution to NPS can be claimed as tax exempt. According to the law, if the employer's contribution to NPS, Employees Provident Fund and any superannuation fund exceeds Rs 7.5 lakh in a financial year, the excess contribution will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Further, any interest, dividend or any returns earned from excess contribution will also be taxable in the hands of the employee.

In the current financial year, the new tax regime does not allow any other deduction or tax exemption except under Section 80CCD (2) and standard deduction from salary and pension income. Hence, if you continue with the new tax regime, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 7.5 lakh through NPS subject to the 10%/14% of salary rule mentioned above. The amount of deduction an individual is eligible for under Section 80CCD (2) is reflected in the Form 16 of the employee.

Remember that the government has tried to make the new tax regime more attractive from the current financial year, 2023-24. The income tax slabs have been revised under the new tax regime; basic tax exemption limit has been hiked by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh; standard deduction has been introduced in the new tax regime for salaried, pensioners and family pensioners; and tax rebate under Section 87A has been increased making zero tax payable for incomes up to Rs 7 lakh. Further, the new tax regime has become the default tax regime. Hence, individuals wanting to opt for the old tax regime will have to specifically choose it, unlike in the previous years when the old tax regime was the default tax regime.

NPS investment under old tax regime

The old tax regime allows an individual to claim deduction (from gross total income) on investment made in NPS under three sections of the Income Tax Act. Apart from deduction under Section 80CCD (2), as mentioned above, it also allows deduction under Section 80CCD (1) and Section 80CCD(1B).

Deduction under Section 80CCD (1): Section 80CCD (1) deduction comes under the overall umbrella of Section 80C. An individual can claim a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh or 10% of basic salary, whichever is lower, by making a contribution to his/her Tier-I NPS account. Hence, if 10% of the basic salary of an individual is lower than Rs 1.5 lakh, the person can claim a deduction of only 10% of basic salary. To fully utilise the benefit of maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, an individual will have to use other avenues specified under Section 80C.

Deduction under Section 80CCD(1B): Section 80CCD(1B) deduction is available over and above Section 80C/80CCD (1) deduction. This deduction can be claimed once an individual exhausts Section 80C/80CCD (1) limit. The maximum deduction allowed under this section is Rs 50,000. Hence, by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS, an individual can claim a deduction under this section. The investment must be made in Tier-I NPS account.

Total deduction of max Rs 9.5 lakh under old regime: Thus, if an individual opts for the old tax regime, they can claim a total deduction of Rs 9.5 lakh under three sections of the Income Tax Act - under Section 80CCD (1) for Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80CCD (1B) for Rs 50,000 and Section 80CCD (2) for Rs 7.5 lakh.",The economic times

Premium Living: Luxury hotel chains expand branded residences on rising demand,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 08:05:00 PM IST","Encouraged by rising demand from high-net-worth individuals, luxury hotel chains in India are expanding their branded residences portfolio to cater to a wealthy clientele seeking premium living experiences.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel and branded residences operator, and the leader in operating standalone branded residences, recently signed up its first JW Marriott-branded residences agreement in India at a tier one city and is in the process of signing up more. Similarly, Hilton is ""actively seeking avenues"" to extend the presence of its luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and in metros to create branded homes.

India's , which signed up with B I Luxury for the first such project in May 2022 under Trident Residencies, will have its apartments and penthouses possession-ready by October this year, Shashank Bhagat, chairman, BI Group, told ET. These standalone properties (not co-located within a hotel premises) boast of five-star amenities and range from ₹18 crore to ₹45 crore. Some of the owners include Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise and Pai family of the Manipal Group.


Access to world-class amenities and personalised services that luxury hotels are identified with, is drawing India's wealthy to these branded residences, said hotel operators and investment advisory firms. They say that the concept is well entrenched in developed hospitality markets like the US, Middle East, and Europe and it is now gaining traction in India.

""Developers are gearing up to seize the immense potential, forging lucrative partnerships. We're actively conducting feasibility studies and brand affiliation assignments for projects in Solan, Chikmagalur, Goa, Dharamshala, and Udaipur,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of Noesis Capital, a hotel consulting and advisory firm.

Penny Trinh, senior director, mixed-use development, APEC, Marriott International, said, ""The increasing number of UHNWIs/HWNIs in India, along with a growing demand among domestic consumers for a lifestyle that mirrors our brands' design, services, and amenities that consumers have come to love during their travels, offers exciting growth opportunities for branded residences.""

Both prime urban locations such as NCR region, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai and resort locations like Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Udaipur are ideal destinations for branded residences, said Trinh. Concurred Suma Venkatesh, executive vice-president, real estate and development, The Indian Hotels Company, the operator of Taj brand of hotels.

""There is potential for Taj branded residences along with a hotel development in every metro city,"" she said. IHCL announced its entry into the branded residences space in April 2022 with the signing of another Taj hotel in Chennai. The new development under a management contract will feature branded residences as part of the hotel complex. The greenfield development will comprise a luxury hotel with 235 keys and 123 Taj branded residences. The construction is underway, she stated.

""We are seeing a healthy demand for this segment fuelled by the boom in the real estate market and growth in wealth accumulated by HNIs. The growing economy and evolving consumer preferences are also some contributing factors to grow the appetite for luxury living experiences; one can only expect more innovation and diversification in this space,"" said Zubin Saxena, senior vice-president and country head, India, Hilton.

Typically, branded residences generate a 30% average price premium over non-branded residences across diverse markets. Homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for reputable brands that offer assurance of quality, she pointed out. Ritz Carlton, Leela Hotels, and Four Seasons that are already operating the branded residences in Mumbai are some of the early movers into the segment.

BI's Bhagat said his ""company is in the process of acquiring land for another project under Oberoi brand in Bengaluru."" The biggest challenge, he pointed out, for such projects specially in metros like Delhi, is land acquisition, said Bhagat.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:39:00 PM IST","Siddharth Srivastava, ETF Products & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), says “from a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide the next momentum to the market.”

Let us begin by discussing the market setup itself. We are very poised at an inflection point where there are no major triggers for the markets because elections are priced in, earnings are behind us, and there is no other major event ready to watch out for. What do you then think is the right expectation in terms of returns from the Indian markets this year?
Siddharth Srivastava: From a valuation point of view, investors should remain cautious, especially in the microcap, smallcap category. There are pockets of opportunities, especially in the largecap and the midcap side. But markets will consolidate. Earnings need to come out at a reasonably good level to justify the valuations where we are currently on. I think that will drive the next possible support in the markets.

From a macroeconomic indicators point of view, there are no red flags. Things look robust. But I think investor expectations this year or for next year or so should be muted. Somewhere around low teens is what investors should be okay with unless and until there is a next good set of news which will provide next momentum to the market.

Low teens is not a bad number at all, right, given the massive returns people have made in the last couple of years.But I want your view specifically on the smallcap end of the market. You have managed to bring out two NFOs in the month gone by, at a time when the rest of the mutual fund industry and some other experts have curbed their inflow into smallcap schemes. What makes you confident about the smallcap space? Don’t you think it is overheated?
Siddharth Srivastava: Again, from a valuation point of view, there is no denying that valuations in the smallcap segment are on the higher side. We are talking about the last five-year average of 22, 12-month forward PE and right now it is somewhere around 26-27. So we are talking about small-caps which are trading at 20% premium or so. But having said that, first it is backed by a reasonable uptick in earnings which was not the case in the last peak in 2017.

We believe that in the long-term, segments like capital goods, financial services, etc. which have reasonable representation in this smallcap space including infrastructure will have a reasonable momentum. So from what we have constructed, we have constructed a portfolio of companies based on quality metrics which will provide sturdiness during bad times if we see market correction going forward and momentum which will probably help us capture the upside. So we are basing our strategy on a mix of quality plus momentum.

Midcaps trump smallcaps in 2024 as investors seek valuation comfort in an overheated race. What lies ahead?

From an investment horizon point of view, we believe that whosoever is investing in smallcaps, be it BR fund or any other fund, he or she should now look at at least a four to six-year horizon. Do lump sum or SIP. SIP will be the preferable mode but that should be the horizon. I do not think that people will get returns which they have seen in the last one year in the coming time. So just manage the expectation. From a 4-6 -year point of view, smallcaps still look okay. You just have to mute your expectations for the coming months or so.

Easy money per se has been made in smallcaps. Going forward, you have to be a bit more selective and cognisant of both the risk as well as the returns you are expecting. But within the smallcap space, which are the baskets that you like more or are you still comfortable in terms of the risk-reward because manufacturing is one space which is getting re-rated? Even defence, industries have been doing well. Which are the areas that you like within smallcap?
Siddharth Srivastava: A fund which we are coming out with is one of the selection parameters which we are using is quality. We have seen that a lot of value-based companies have had a very good run-up recently. But we feel that something based on quality where you are basically picking companies which are good on profitability, have reasonable financial health and have an earnings stability of the past five years or so.

Have that stability, something which we expect will do well in coming times. Quality has not performed well in the last one-two years. From a smallcap point of view, that is where we see more opportunity.

Looking at a bit of a churn, what has not performed might just catch up a bit. But which are the spaces where you would recommend profit booking? Which smallcap sector or theme is looking very overheated, if any?
Siddharth Srivastava: There are obviously sectors like defence, infrastructure, especially some of the value companies, the PSU companies have run up significantly. So investors can probably look at booking their profit at those segments. Valuation needs to be keenly watched. If something is obviously trading at a very overheated multiples, there are several cases in smallcaps and microcaps, especially in the segments which I have mentioned where people can book profit, and if they want to exit, can exit.

Indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge inducted into Indian Army,"Last Updated: Feb 27, 2024, 03:56:00 PM IST","A 46-metre indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridge was inducted into the Indian Army on Tuesday, a move that will bolster the crucial bridging capability of the force's engineers. The induction ceremony took place at the Manekshaw Centre here in the presence of Army chief General Manoj Pande and senior officials of the Army and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

""Over the next four years, a total of 41 sets, valued at Rs 2,585 crore, will be progressively inducted. The first set was inducted on Tuesday,"" a senior official said.

These ""game-changing bridges"" have been designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and produced by L&T as a DRDO-nominated production agency.

The modular bridge is a ""mechanically-launched single-span, fully-decked 46-metre assault bridge, enabling the Army to overcome obstacles, such as canals and ditches, with ease. It will augment the crucial bridging capability of the Indian Army's engineers as these bridges are highly mobile, rugged, and designed for quick deployment and retrieval, aligning with the fast-paced nature of mechanised operations,"" the official said.

The induction of the modular bridge also highlights India's ""prowess in designing and developing advanced military equipment"" and underscores the country's commitment to ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat"" and self-reliance in defence production, the Army said.

The contract for the procurement of the modular bridges was signed with L&T in February 2023.

Each set of the modular bridge consists of ""seven carrier vehicles based on 8x8 heavy mobility vehicles and two launcher vehicles based on 10x10 heavy mobility vehicles"", the Army said.

These bridges can be employed over various types of obstacles like canals and ditches with quick launching and retrieval capabilities. The equipment is highly mobile, versatile, rugged and capable of keeping pace with wheeled and tracked mechanised vehicles, it added.

The modular bridges will replace the manually-launched medium girder bridges (MGBs) that are currently being used in the Army. The indigenously designed and manufactured modular bridges shall have many advantages over the MGBs, such as an increased span, less time for construction and mechanical launching with retrieval capability, officials said.

The acquisition of these bridges not only enhances the Army's operational effectiveness, but also showcases India's growing prominence in defence technology and manufacturing, they said.

Pro-Pak slogans in Karnataka House: BJP says Congress 'anti-national',"Feb 28, 2024, 18:18 IST","NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on Wednesday criticized the Congress party for purportedly chanting 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans outside the Karnataka assembly.

This is a very worrying incident, this is an insult to India's democracy.""

According to the complaint lodged by the Karnataka BJP, it was claimed that following the announcement of Hussain's election to the Rajya Sabha by the returning officer around 7 pm on Tuesday, his supporters assembled at the Vidhana Soudha premises allegedly at Hussain's behest. It was alleged that they suddenly erupted into loud chants of 'Pakistan Zindabad' while cheering for Hussain.
""Congress' DNA has become anti-national. Earlier, slogans like Bharat will break into pieces, Insha Allah, Insha Allah, were raised at a public event attended by Rahul Gandhi. Don't you think Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge should apologise?"" he said.

Initially Congress refuted these allegations, asserting that its workers were merely chanting slogans in support of Hussain, not as claimed by the BJP. In contrast, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stated that voice samples had been dispatched to the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory), emphasizing that those responsible would face consequences.
""We have sent the voice report to the FSL, if it is true that somebody has raised the slogan 'Pakistan Zindabad', that person will be punished seriously,"" Siddaramaiah said.
Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said, ""We are very serious about it. If it is an anti-national slogan, we will not tolerate it. We will take strict actions, once it is confirmed by the FSL team. FIR has already registered yesterday. We have to identify the person from the FSL report and if it is true, we will take action against him.""
As per the complaint filed by the Karnataka BJP, it was alleged that after the returning officer declared that Hussain was elected to the Rajya Sabha, at around 7 pm on Tuesday, his supporters, who had gathered at the premises of the Vidhana Soudha ""at the instance of Hussain, suddenly shouted 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans in a loud manner while cheering for Hussain.""

Google CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ...completely unacceptable and we got it wrong,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 13:00 IST","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has sent a strongly-worded memo to employees on the recent controversy regarding its AI chatbot Gemini's image generation too. In an internal memo to employees, which first appeared in Semafor, Pichai called the Gemini's responses around race unacceptable and vowed to make structural changes to fix the problem.
Google suspended its Gemini image creation tool last week after it generated embarrassing and offensive results, in some cases declining to depict white people.
The search results even inaccurately portrayed the races of Google’s own co-founders. Post the controversy, Google publicly apologised for “missing the mark” and said that it’s working to re-enable image generation in the coming weeks. The company accepted that it ""over compensated"" for diversity in some cases. Pichai's memo to employees is the first time that the Google CEO has spoken on the issue.
Here's the Google CEO Sundar Pichai's letter as it appeared on Semafor:
I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias – to be clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong.

How Ram Lalla helped BJP hone in on 'vulnerable' SP MLAs,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 17:17 IST","LUCKNOW: Ram Lalla emerged as a decisive factor behind the victory of BJP's eighth candidate Sanjay Seth in Rajya Sabha elections held in UP on Tuesday, despite the odds stacked against the party. Seven SP MLAs broke ranks and voted for BJP candidates, paving the way for Seth's win. Seth secured 29 first preference votes, while SP's third candidate, former IAS officer Alok Ranjan, received only 19.

BJP's strategy to identify these seven SP legislators was orchestrated by key figures from govt, including CM Yogi Adityanath, and ministers Suresh Khanna and JPS Rathore, along with top party leaders such as state party chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and general secretary (organisation) Dharampal.

The task became straightforward as BJP honed in on SP MLAs who had publicly supported the consecration of Ram Lalla's idol at Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on Jan 22. ""Those MLAs who, despite the party's silence on the issue, had strongly supported the consecration event. All of them were approached and many of them reciprocated,"" said a BJP leader.

Among the identified SP legislators were Rakesh Pratap Singh, Abhay Singh, Vinod Chaturvedi, and Manoj Pandey. After the RS election results were announced, Abhay Singh tweeted: ""Voting has been done in a transparent manner. We have voted on our will. After the Ram Temple was opened, the Assembly Speaker invited all MLAs for darshan, but SP stopped its legislators. This was not right."" Similarly, Jansatta Dal founder Raghuraj Pratap Singh's vocal support for PM Modi and CM Yogi after the consecration ceremony made him an accessible target for BJP leaders seeking support.

Similarly, Jansatta Dal founder Raghuraj Pratap Singh’s vocal support for PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi after the consecration ceremony made him an accessible target for BJP leaders seeking support. Singh, also known as Raja Bhaiya, played pivotal roles in contacting potential defectors from SP and securing their allegiance to BJP.
The efficient identification of vulnerable MLAs made the process of winning over SP legislators remarkably swift, taking less than a week from initial contact to cross-voting, sources said.
While acknowledging the instrumental roles played by top UP BJP leaders and Raja Bhaiya in convincing some MLAs to switch sides, sources emphasised the symbolic significance of Lord Ram in identifying the susceptible MLAs within the SP camp.",Times Of India
"How this Delhi cabbie took passengers for ride, looted them dry","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:43 IST","NEW DELHI: For a 24-year-old Noida resident, who boarded a cab near Anand Vihar railway station in Delhi to his Sector 58 house, the ride turned out to be probably his longest ever.

The driver seemed educated, friendly and chatty, and struck up a conversation. Thirsty, the passenger drank the water offered by the cabbie and fell into a deep sleep. He woke up on the roadside 12 hours later and found his iPhone, wallet, cash, gold and rings missing.
The railway police, which was informed three days later, prepared an electronic route using phone locations and tracked down the cabbie, who turned out to be the kingpin of a drug-and-rob gang from Ghaziabad's Khoda colony, said cops.
He has been identified as Sagar (35).

According to DCP (KPS) Malhotra, the incident took place on Feb 17. Police received a complaint on Feb 20, in which the victim narrated the details of his ordeal. He said that he had come to Anand Vihar railway station to take a train to Kanpur but could not get a reserved ticket. So, he decided to return home to Ghaziabad. The man said he was looking for a taxi outside the station when the cabbie approached him and offered him a ride at a much lower price than what app-based cabs were showing.

Induced by the offer, the man boarded the taxi. On the way, he told the cabbie to stop as he wanted to buy a water bottle. The driver, he said, took out a water bottle and offered it to the passenger, saying he kept these things as a good gesture towards his customer. The passenger drank and woke up to find his valuables, including Rs 16,000 cash, documents, iPhone and rings gone.
Following the complaint, DCP Malhotra formed a team comprising ASI Sanjay Nagar and head constable Mohan Gautam. The team scrutinised more than 300 CCTV cameras installed at and around Anand Vihar railway station. However, the suspect could not be identified as there were few blank spots where the movement of persons/vehicle couldn't be captured on the CCTV cameras.
""Thereafter, call detail records (CDR) of the stolen mobile phone were obtained and a route map was prepared using the locations of the mobile phone. The team then again scrutinised the CCTV cameras on this route, which was prepared by superimposing the locations of the mobile phone,"" DCP Malhotra said.
The exercise finally fetched results and the suspect was captured in one of the CCTV cameras.
Local sources were also deployed to nab the culprit. Sagar, the suspect, was tracked down and arrested.
The stolen mobile phone and gold ornaments were allegedly mortgaged by the accused and are being retrieved, an officer said.",Times Of India
End of the road: Why Apple’s electric car plans had a bumpy ride,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 17:44 IST","It was celebrated Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez who said, “All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.” This is completely true for companies as well. Except Apple. The company has two lives: public and secret. All of its plans are shrouded in so much secrecy that perhaps they made them sign their own version of the “unbreakable wow” ala Harry Potter series.

Yet, some secrets are worst-kept, and one such thing was Apple’s electric car.
Now, it seems Apple has pulled the plug this week on its stop-start, stop-start automotive venture, as Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports. Codenamed ""Project Titan,"" Apple's secretive car project has hit the end of the road and may go down as a classic case of one of those ‘what ifs’ and a rare mishit from the spaceship campus in Cupertino.
Apple never openly admitted that it is working on a car, though there were hints galore. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day. I’m not saying that one will not,” Cook said in a 2021 interview when quizzed about Apple’s car plans.
“The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we’ll see what Apple does,” Cook said. That is perhaps the closest you can get Apple to confirm — or deny — that it was indeed working on an electric car plan.

While Apple executives may have once harboured visions of revolutionising personal transportation, the writing had long been on the wall for Project Titan's termination, according to insider sources interviewed by Bloomberg.
A money pit from the start
Reported to have begun a decade ago in 2014, Project Titan reportedly blew through billions of dollars as Apple embarked on pie-in-the-sky plans to create an electric vehicle powered by self-driving software and breakthrough battery technology, according to sources cited in Bloomberg’s report. A report by The New York Times suggests that in the last five years, Apple has spent $113 billion on research and development. So it is anyone’s guess how much was earmarked for the electric car, but you can be sure that it would have many zeroes at the end.

Apple went on a hiring spree as well. So much so that it prompted Elon Musk to comment on it as well. “They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard’. If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding,” Musk told a German news outlet in 2015. That’s pretty much around the same time Apple’s electric car rumours began to swirl and gather momentum.
Hundreds of engineers were supposedly working at developing custom components across the entire vehicle stack in a skunkworks-style operation cloaked in secrecy, noted the Bloomberg report. Early prototypes rumoredly built by magnesium-specialist subsidiary Mesa Rim hint at irresistible ""iPhone on wheels"" dreams reportedly starting to crystallise within Apple's design labs at the time.
Year after year, rosy forecasts seemingly promised Apple was rounding the corner toward launching its first vehicle. But a steady talent bleed from the project hinted that all was not well with the plan, suggests the Bloomberg report.
High-profile names attached to Titan during its early days had already abandoned the ship even before this month's news. Critical players departing in recent years included Project Titan heads Doug Field, Bob Mansfield, and Steve Zadesky, along with countless other directors and VPs representing decades of combined automotive expertise.
The road less travelled
So what went wrong? That’s anyone’s guess, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has some ideas, and he does have a record of getting it right when it comes to Apple.
Project Titan has long been reported to have perpetually failed to capitalise on flying starts, according to longtime Apple employees as quoted in the report. Field's appointment in 2018 marked the third major reboot, with his fresh mandate to have a passenger vehicle ready by 2023.
Impressed by Tesla's success, Field put Apple's custom technologies aside to refocus the project around integrated software and commercialising self-driving car hardware. But despite the said public testing that followed in California and Arizona, developmental hurdles proved too daunting on Apple's compressed new timeline. Rather than push ahead gratefully on the momentum or trim ambitious features to get something into consumers' hands, the company found itself back at the drawing board.
By late 2021, yet another strategy pivot was reported aimed at reducing Project Titan's scope closer to market viability. After years stuck in research paralysis, Apple finally acknowledged sweeping self-driving capabilities were out of reach for the foreseeable future and pivoted again; this time, the plan was to build an electric car much like how Teslas are, and if the insiders are to be quoted this would have been ready to hit the roads by 2026. Though, that isn’t happening anymore.
Driving in a new lane
By abandoning Project Titan, Apple swallows hard in reportedly acknowledging over $10 billion spent and countless late nights that ultimately went nowhere. Having a market cap of close to $3 trillion means that Apple can afford a few big bets that never reach consumers. But by moving the remaining Project Titan team to work on AI and augmented reality instead, Apple is making a practical choice.
Apple may have just realised what Musk said in 2021, “Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is excruciating.” After all, the man knows better than most people in the world how to make a successful electric car company.
“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that,” said Cook in a 2021 interview. The magic hasn’t happened in the car at this time, but who knows as Apple has the hardware, software, and services, so the car that never was might just be on the road someday.",Times Of India
"Stock market crash today: Why BSE Sensex has plunged 800 points, Nifty5o is below 22,000 - top reasons","Feb 28, 2024, 15:27 IST","Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian benchmark equity plunged in trade on Wednesday. Nifty50 dropped below the crucial 22,000 level, while BSE Sensex, the broader market index, fell by around 800 points or 1% to reach a low of 72,300. The sell-off was even more pronounced in the midcaps, smallcaps, and microcap segments, with their respective indices experiencing a decline of approximately 2%.

As a result, investors on Dalal Street witnessed a collective loss of about Rs 6 lakh crore, as the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks dropped to Rs 386 lakh crore, according to an ET report.
Nifty had been moving sideways in a consolidation phase, but its consistent closure above the 22,000 mark for eight consecutive sessions indicated a positive trend. However, technical analysts now believe that if the index sustains the breakout below 22,000, it could trigger a downward movement.
Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services stated that in the near term, the market is expected to remain range-bound. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have significantly reduced their selling this month and have become net buyers of Rs 872 crore in the cash market so far in February, despite the high US bond yields. This suggests that FIIs are unlikely to engage in large-scale selling, which could cause a sharp decline in the market.""

Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today:

1) Sebi takes action: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has taken notice of the soaring prices of smallcaps and midcaps. It has instructed mutual funds to disclose more information about the risks associated with these segments, where liquidity could be a challenge. Mutual funds will now have to reveal the time it might take to accommodate large redemptions, the potential impact of significant outflows on portfolio value, and the amount of cash and liquid assets held to meet such outflows.

2) Diminishing hopes from the US Federal Reserve: Market participants are eagerly awaiting the release of the US' personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) data for January, as it could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rate hikes. The probability of a rate cut in the June meeting has dropped to 59%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
3) Concerns about valuations: With the market cap-to-GDP ratio surpassing 120%, investors are becoming increasingly uneasy about valuations, particularly in the broader market. Despite the conclusion of the December quarter earnings season, expectations for the fiscal year 2025 have not shown significant changes.
4) Global market trends: MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan, experienced a decline of 0.44% to reach 525.40 points, although it remains close to a seven-month high of 531.56 after a strong rally. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 also edged 0.3% lower, while Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite both recorded declines of 1.4% and 1.9% respectively.
5) Influence of monthly F&O expiry: Some of the market volatility can be attributed to the monthly Futures and Options (F&O) expiry scheduled for tomorrow. ""For the February monthly series, the 22,200 call option has significant open interest, followed by the 22,300 strike. On the put side, the 22,200 strike has significant open interest, followed by the 22,100 strike, indicating that the range of 22,140-22,120 will serve as immediate support for the index. On the upside, the level of 22,270 will act as immediate resistance,"" according to SBI Securities.
6) Profit-taking: In recent weeks, the market sentiment has been dominated by two opposing themes: buying the dip and selling the rise. While valuations support the case for booking profits, a surge of retail investments is providing some protection on the downside.",Times Of India
"Decongestion directives showing result in Mumbai, more on time arrivals now: Govt","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 18:07 IST","NEW DELHI: The Union aviation ministry on Wednesday said its recent directives to cut number of daily flights at Mumbai and airlines being ordered to adhere to slots there has led to an “improvement in the air traffic situation” at the choked Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) from Feb 19 onwards. A flight taking off or landing within 15 minutes of scheduled time of departure or arrival is considered an on time movement.

Data shared by the ministry said a month-long period before the directives were issued saw only 25% of the flights arriving in time at CSMIA. But this number rose to 57% in a week-long period after the directives were in force. Given the fact that Mumbai Airport has severe infra constraints and had given way more slots than it should have, flights not adhering to schedule add to the problem of delayed arrivals and departures.
Citing figure for a month between Nov 11, 2023, and Dec 10 — before government intervention, — the ministry said of the 14,476 arrivals in that period, only 25.1% (3,362) came within 15 minutes of their scheduled time of arrival (STA). About 34% (4,979) came before their STA and the remaining 40.5% (5,865) were late anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour.

On the other hand, government data says Feb 16-24 — when the directives were in force — saw 4,337 arrivals of which 2,469 or 57% came within 0-15 minutes of their STA. Before STA fell to 13% (570) and 30% (1,298) were delayed anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour.
An analysis conducted by Airports Authority of India (AAI) pointed to excessive slot allocation and poor slot adherence as a major contributor to the traffic congestion witnessed, a government statement issued Wednesday said. “On Feb 15, the ministry directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during
HIRO period and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during remaining period with provision of two slots for general aviation aircraft. Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) in coordination with airlines has implemented the directions effective since Feb 20. All domestic airline operators were also advised to strictly adhere to the slots allocated by MIAL to avoid air congestion,” the Jyotiraditya Scindia-led aviation ministry said in a statement Wednesday. Scindia had intervened and got the directives for improving Mumbai on time performance earlier this month.

“Aircraft ahead of schedule lead to congestion and delay other aircraft adhering to the schedule, which in turn will have a cascading effect on the other schedule movements. These movements were also targeted for improvements and airlines asked to adhere to the allotted slots. We are closely monitoring the air traffic situation at Mumbai and are committed to reduce the inconvenience caused to the travelling passenger,” the statement added. Scindia had intervened and got the directives for improving Mumbai on time performance issued on Feb 13.
“Mumbai is one of busiest airports in India, handling a large volume of domestic and international flights including military, non-scheduled and general aviation flights. CSMIA has two intersecting runways which cannot be operated simultaneously resulting in single runway operations with a peak hour declared capacity of 46 aircraft movement (arrival or departure) in an hour, during ‘high intensity runway operations’ (HIRO) and 44 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period,” the ministry statement said.
“During the winter schedule 2023, (CSMIA) has been experiencing frequent congestion leading to aircraft hovering overhead for a significant duration causing inconvenience due to delay passengers, wastage of fuel and environmental pollution. In an effort to address the issue of airspace congestion, the ministry on Jan 2, 2024, directed the airport operator (MIAL) and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to mitigate congestion by restricting the movements of non-scheduled flights (general aviation) during the identified peak hours (8-11 am, 5-8 pm and 9.15-11.15 pm).”
On Feb 15, the ministry directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during HIRO period and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during remaining period with provision of two slots for general aviation aircraft. “Airport operator in coordination with airlines has implemented the directions effective since Feb 20.

In the exclusive interview Tom told The Mirror that, ""Charles is also aware that, as future king, William is at the heart of the succession planning that is taking place right now – officials had assumed Charles would remain healthy at least into his mid-eighties before succession planning would need to begin but in fact it has now begun and indicates perhaps that Charles’ cancer is more dangerous than we have been led to believe.”

""Succession planning is highly secret and no one trusts Harry to be part of it for the simple reason that if he feels in any way slighted or not given what he feels he deserves he will run straight to the media.""
Prince Harry sparked controversy with the release of his memoir ""Spare,"" where he criticized several family members. The book delved into his strained relationship with his brother, Prince William, and also included criticisms of his father. Additionally, Harry and Meghan Markle's Netflix docuseries featured further critiques of the royal family.

Zaheer Khan was someone I used to watch a lot to try and learn from: James Anderson,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 15:48 IST","NEW DELHI: James Anderson, England's premier fast bowler, renowned for his exceptional longevity and approaching the historic milestone of 700 international wickets, attributes some of his skills, notably in the art of reverse swing, to the teachings of Indian great Zaheer Khan.
At 41, Anderson remains the linchpin of England's bowling attack, poised to become the first fast bowler ever to surpass the 700-wicket milestone.

Joining the exclusive company of spin maestros Muttiah Muralitharan and the late Shane Warne, who have achieved 700 plus wickets in Test cricket, would mark a historic achievement for Anderson.
""For me, Zaheer Khan was someone I used to watch a lot to try and learn from. How he used the reverse swing, how he covered the ball when he ran into bowl, that's something I tried to sort of develop on the back of playing against him quite a few times here,"" Anderson told JioCinema.

Having concluded his Test career in 2014, Zaheer, one of India's standout seam bowlers, witnessed Anderson's peak form during that period.
In the present cohort of Indian pacers, Anderson expresses profound admiration for Jasprit Bumrah, acknowledging him as a ""remarkable exponent"" of the art of reverse swing.
Asked about Bumrah's match-winning performance in the second Test against England, Anderson said, ""With someone of his quality you expect that standard from him. You know that reverse swing can play a big part in India and he's a great exponent of it. He's got good pace and is very accurate, very consistent.
India vs England 4th Test: India beat England, secure 17th straight Test series win at home

""That yorker we saw to Ollie Pope, he's got that up his sleeve as well. It's not a fluke that he's got to number one in the world. He's a world-class bowler and from our point of view we weren't surprised that he put up a performance like that.""
The seasoned Englishman added, ""There are not many better bowlers than Bumrah, Shami and Siraj. They're world-class bowlers. You put Ishant Sharma in there as well, and that's a really strong bowling attack.""
Anderson's longevity in the game can be ascertained by the fact that his current England teammates such as Shoaib Bashir and Rehan Ahmed were not even born when he made his Test debut way back in 2002.
Having played 186 Tests and 194 ODIs over the last 22 years, Anderson's desire to be competitive remains intact.
On comparing his longevity to other sporting legends, Anderson said, ""Yeah, I guess you do look at things like that, but to be honest, I just go with the feel of me and my body. I don't feel like I'm 41 years and 200 days old. You know, I still feel young.
""I can keep up with the young guys in training. I can still bowl the speeds that I want to, I can still deliver the skills that I want to. So, for me that's the most important thing. Age is just a number and it's pretty irrelevant from my thought process.""
When the discussion turned to reverse swing, Anderson said the art remains relevant even in an age dominated by T20 cricket.
""I don't think it's dying. Because of the growth of white-ball cricket in recent times, the focus has moved to change of pace and different deliveries like yorkers, and things like that.
""But for me, in Test cricket, we've seen throughout this series already that swing can play a big part.
""The way Bumrah's bowled, I think, has been amazing to watch. That reverse swing spell in the second Test was one of the best you'll see. For me, I think there's still people out there wanting to learn the skills and it's not easy to do.""
With star batter Virat Kohli skipping the ongoing Test series due to personal reasons, Anderson said he missed bowling to the Indian maestro with he had had some fascinating duels.
""You always want to play against the best players. And it's been a shame that he's not been a part of the series. We have had some great battles over the years.""

Civilian team reaches Maldives to replace Indian military personnel,"Feb 28, 2024, 15:19 IST","NEW DELHI: A civilian team from India has reached Maldives on Wednesday to take charge of one of three aviation platforms in Maldives ahead of the March 10 deadline for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the island nation.
Quoting a statement by Maldives defence ministry, the local media reported that the civilian team to operate and maintain the aircraft arrived in Addu early last night to complete the takeover process.

On Wednesday, the news portal also said, test flights will be held today (Wednesday), before the helicopter is taken to India for repairs. An Indian ship will dock in Addu on the 28th of this month carrying the replacement helicopter.
Further quoting the defence ministry statement, it said, the Indian troops will withdraw from the Maldives on the dates agreed upon by the two countries.

The development comes days after Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu announced in his maiden address to Parliament on February 5 that first group of Indian military personnel will be sent back from the island nation before March 10. The remaining Indians manning the two aviation platforms will be withdrawn by May 10 according to the agreement between the two countries.
There are 88 military personnel manning the three Indian platforms that have been providing humanitarian and medical evacuation services to the people of the Maldives for the last few years using two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft.

Soon after taking oath as the President on November 17, Muizzu formally requested India to withdraw 88 military personnel from his country by March 15, saying the Maldivian people had given him a ""strong mandate"" to make this request to New Delhi.
After the latest round of bilateral talks, India said on February 2 that a ""set of mutually workable solutions"" was agreed upon with the Maldives for continuing the operations of Indian aviation platforms in the island nation.
The Maldives' proximity to India, barely 70 nautical miles from the island of Minicoy in Lakshadweep and 300 nautical miles from the mainland's western coast, and its location at the hub of commercial sea lanes running through the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives it significant strategic importance.
The Maldives has been India's key maritime neighbour in the IOR and it occupies a special place in its initiatives such as SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the Neighbourhood First Policy.'

Director Koldo Serra on parallels between 'Reina Roja' villain Ezekiel and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker: Interesting that the audience can empathise with villains - Exclusive,"Feb 28, 2024, 17:57 IST","Director Koldo Serra, known for his work on acclaimed web series like 'Money Heist' and 'No Traces', brings yet another gripping thriller titled 'Reina Roja'. Ahead of the release of the adaptation of Juan Gómez-Jurado's hit crime trilogy, Serra sheds light on the complexities of villainy in the series. In conversation with ETimes, director Koldo shared his insights into the crime genre, the allure of morally complex characters, and the similarities between his new villain Ezekiel played by Nacho Fresneda, and iconic villains like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Star Wars' Darth Vader. With his unique perspective and experience, Serra offers a deeper understanding of the series and its intriguing characters. Excerpts:
You came on board for Reina Roja right after 'Money Heist' and 'No Traces'. What is it about the crime genre that excites you the most? And why do you think Hovik was perfect to play the cop Jon?
After 'Money Heist' and 'No Traces', I wanted to take a vacation. I said 'no' to all the projects they offered me, until I got 'Reina Roja'. The possibility of working again with Hovik was exciting (laughs). I thought the scripts were so well-written and funny. The characters of Jon and Antonia had so much soul, that you couldn't say 'no' to it. The team was like a dream so there was no discussion, I had to be there.

When it's a grey-shaded villain like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker or Ezekiel in 'Reina Roja', it tends to stick with the audience. What do you think makes for a good on-screen villain?
You mentioned Joker as an example. He's a character that, even though he's a villain, you can connect with because there's a lot of grey, not just black and white. Well, I think what's really interesting is that the audience can empathise with them. In Ezekiel's case, that empathy comes from understanding him, even if you don't share his beliefs. I think it's important to understand that he's not bad without some other factors coming into play. And then, obviously, he's very attractive. The bad side of things is always fun to interpret, and I think they were wonderfully represented in cinema through Darth Vader and now Ezekiel.
With its release on Prime Video on February 29th, audiences can expect a riveting narrative that challenges conventional perceptions of heroism and villainy. Starring Vicky Luengo and Hovik Keuchkerian in lead roles, the story follows Antonia Scott, as the ""Red Queen"". With an IQ of 242, she is inducted into a secret, experimental police project.

The incident came to light after the employer’s driver noticed the front door ajar and the house ransacked in the early hours of Feb 23.
In his police complaint, Prasada Rao Kamineni, 46, identified the prime suspects as Kamal and Deeksha, both aged between 23 and 25 years. A senior police officer said the accused couple is suspected to be heading towards Nepal. Kamineni owns a multi-storey building on III Cross in Sunshine Layout. The accused couple stayed in the basement — Kamal was the building’s security guard, while Deeksha was working in Kamineni’s house for one-and-a-half years. Kamineni had rented out the first, second and third floors. His family lived in a duplex flat on the fourth and fifth floors.
On Feb 21, Kamineni and family locked the house around 8am and left for Ayodhya on a pilgrimage. Kamineni asked his car driver Ravi Kumar to keep watch and gave him a set of keys for the main metal door.
Two days later, Kamineni received a call from Kumar, saying the front door was ajar. Kamineni asked him to check inside the house and Kumar said the doors of a few rooms were opened and clothes and other valuables were lying scattered on the floor. Kumar said the Nepali couple was missing since morning.

Kishan has been on an extended break ""due to personal reasons"" since coming back from the India tour of South Africa in December-January. He has been practicing with his Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya at Baroda, but has not turned out for Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy despite being told to play the tournament by the Indian Board.
Iyer was absent from Mumbai's final Ranji Trophy league match against Assam at BKC and also missed the Ranji quarter-final against Baroda.

"Airtel is 'changing' its SIM cards, here's the 'good' reason","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 18:21 IST","Airtel has announced its move to switch partnership from virgin plastic to recycled PVC SIM cards.

How Airtel’s recycled PVC SIM cards are good for environment
Airtel became the first telecommunications service provider to switch to recycled plastic SIM cards.
With this migration, the generation of over 165 tonnes of virgin plastic will be limited which will further reduce the generation of over 690 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in one year.
This migration is in line with Airtel’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gases and promoting circularity with supplier partners and other stakeholders with the aim of encouraging them to reduce waste, recycle and reuse products.

Vodafone in talks to sell Italian unit to Swisscom,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 17:29 IST","LONDON: British telecoms giant Vodafone said Wednesday it was in advanced talks to sell its Italian unit to Switzerland's Swisscom after rejecting offers from French billionaire Xavier Noel's Iliad group.

Shares in Vodafone, which has been on a cost-cutting campaign that has included layoffs and the offloading of divisions abroad, rose following the announcement.
The disclosure of the negotiations with Swisscom comes a month after the British mobile phone operator rejected an Iliad offer to merge their Italian units.

Vodafone said in a statement that it had ""engaged extensively with several parties to explore market consolidation in Italy"".
The potential transaction with Swisscom ""delivers the best combination of value creation, upfront cash proceeds and transaction certainty for Vodafone shareholders"", it added.
The two companies, however, cautioned in separate statements that there was no certainty the transaction would ultimately be agreed.

The acquisition of Vodafone Italy would be on a cash and debt-free basis, the companies said.
A source close to the matter told AFP that Vodafone preferred a deal with the Swiss group because of its ""significant cash element"" and a higher degree of certainty that the deal could be completed, as it would have a better chance of being approved by Italian regulators.
Swisscom said it would merge Vodafone Italy with its own Italian unit, Fastweb.
Last month, Vodafone rejected a proposal from Iliad to merge their Italian businesses in a deal valuing Vodafone Italy at 10.45 billion euros.
The British mobile phone operator had already rebuffed an 11.25-billion-euro approach by Iliad and private equity group Apax Partners in February 2022.
Niel has since taken a 2.5-percent stake in Vodafone.
- Job cuts -
Vodafone reported earlier this month that its third-quarter revenues fell 2.3 percent to 11.4 billion euros on poor performances across Italy and Spain.
In late 2023, Vodafone's chief executive Margherita Della Valle announced the sale of its Spanish division to investment fund Zegona for up to five billion euros.
It followed her decision last year to axe 11,000 jobs, or more than 10 percent of Vodafone's global workforce, to slash costs.
Britain's competition regulator, meanwhile, is investigating Vodafone's plan to merge its British mobile phone operations with those of Three UK, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.
Vodafone also completed the sale of its Hungarian unit last year.
""The telecoms group has been stuck in the mud for a long time, trying to revive growth and reignite a spark in the business,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.
""Work to streamline the group has already involved various deals but the market is still not convinced Vodafone has found the magic solution judging by its share price performance over the past five years,"" he said.
""The Italian deal, if successful, is a step in the right direction but only one small piece of the puzzle,"" he added.
Vodafone shares were up 0.7 percent in the London stock exchange in late morning deals.
Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that the proposed transaction would follow ""hot on the heels"" of Vodafone's sale of its Spanish business.
""This is part of Vodafone's evolving strategy to improve its performance against its peers,"" Streeter said.
""But low sales growth relative to spending is still set to weigh on the company even as it offloads underperforming divisions,"" she said.",Times Of India

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"With new fund infusion, does Vodafone Idea stand a chance of revival?","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:20:00 PM IST","Vodafone Idea, the telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group with the government as the largest shareholder, might be about to turn a corner. Crumbling under debt, government charges, losses and eroding market share, the telco has struggled to raise funds for the past few years. In a business with deep-pocket rivals such as Reliance Jio, a beleaguered Vodafone Idea would stand little chance of surviving. However, the government wants it to keep running to prevent the Jio-Airtel duopoly to control the telecom market. The government became the largest stakeholder in Vi with a 33.1% stake in February last year, when the telecom department converted the company’s accrued interest on deferred adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues worth Rs 16,133 crore into equity.

But now there's a ray of hope for Vodafone Idea. The telco has announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt. A capital infusion is just what it needs but will it help the telco come out of a long crisis of survival?

The decline of Vodafone Idea
Since 2007, when Hutch was rebranded as Vodafone, the Indian telecom industry has been through dramatic changes. With massive subscriber growth, 3G around the corner, and new players in the fray, average revenue per user (ARPU) started to come down. Companies began to focus more on shareholder returns and competition turned ugly in the shape of cut-throat pricing wars. Later, the stormy entry of Jio created string tremors with huge price cuts. Over more than a decade, Vodafone and Idea in particular lost ground to the competition. Jio came as a big shock. While Airtel too faced trouble, it managed to fight it out.

Rather than a consolidation and the synergies making things better, the merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular in 2018 worsened the situation for the new entity. Ideally, synergies should've been one of the factors leading to the merger between Vodafone & Idea. However, in reality things were the other way around: It was the merged entity that later started looking for synergies. “If two large organisations are merging not because of synergies but out of desperation, the merged entity will face a lot of challenges,” Amit Mantri, co-founder of portfolio-management service 2Point2 Capital, had told ET at that time. Consequently, Vodafone Idea struggled with its post-merger blues -- lack of strategic direction; integration issues in networks and human resources; and challenges related to cultural fit. The core values and structure of Vodafone and Idea were different — Idea was a promoter-led company and Vodafone was a global professionally run organisation. The merged entity could never take off just as the competition grew, new technology demanded more capital and payouts to the government weighed on the telco.

Vodafone Idea’s gross debt at the end of the third quarter stood at a huge Rs 2.15 lakh crore, comprising deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1.38 lakh crore, AGR liability of Rs 69,020 crore due to the government, dues worth Rs 6,050 crore towards banks and financial institutions, and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1,660 crore. As the debt widened in the fiscal third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore. The company says its bank debt now stands at less than Rs 4,500 crore.

The company has been reporting quarterly losses as well as losing subscribers to Airtel and Reliance Jio month after month. Airtel and Reliance Jio's ARPU, a key performance metric for telecom companies, stood at Rs 208 and Rs 181.7 respectively in the December quarter, for Vodafone Idea the same was Rs 145.

Airtel and Jio added 3 million and 1.21 million active users respectively in December, while Vi lost 1.84 million active users, latest customer data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed. Trai's wireless broadband user data showed that Jio and Airtel added 14.37 million and 9.7 million 4G/5G users respectively in December, while Vi added 0.66 million 3G/4G users.

However, in the quarter, the company focused on paying off external dues and reduced vendor overdues over capital investments that dramatically lagged peers Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel spending on 4G and 5G expansion. ""Vi repaid Rs 1,900 crore of external dues (versus Rs 400-500 crore according to original schedule) and repaid Rs 1,300 crore of vendor overdues from the cash generation in Q3FY24 and income tax refunds,"" stock research firm Kotak Institutional Equities had said in a report.

How the funds infusion can help
Vodafone Idea has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. The large capital infusion of Rs 45,000 crore will be used to pay the government and large vendors like Indus Towers too.

Will it work?
Will this capital infusion put Vodafone Idea in reckoning with its bigger rivals Jio and Airtel? Paying out the government and vendors, expanding the 4G services and rolling out the 5G can surely help the telco plug leakages and add market share. But will it strengthen the company enough to enable it to compete with its rivals?

""Operationally, this fund-raise is surely a step in the right direction. This will enable VIL to improve its 4G services and catch up (to some extent) with peers on 5G rollout, to be able to arrest the subscribers' decline and make meaningful EBITDA to be able to service the debt obligations. Financially, however, the fund-raise size is too small, to have any meaningful impact,"" said Nuvama's Vibhor Singhal.

There could be challenges with debt servicing too.""We will also have to see how they are going to service that debt because there has been no bank default by Vodafone,"" Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, has told ET Now. ""They are already servicing a large debt which they have to pay to the Government of India and also the rest of it. So I would say it is a positive direction and an ambitious target. But we need more clarity on how they are going to fund that.""

Also, the telco’s annual payouts to the government would jump to an estimated Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past AGR-related dues.

In the near term, Nomura said that a significant fund-raise will be a material positive and will enable the company to cover upcoming dues, commence its 5G rollout, and improve its operational performance by curtailing the decline in the subscriber base in the near term and start growing the subscriber base again in the coming years. ""We note that if VIL can tie up the entire fund raise, it will be a material positive; however, VIL will not be fully out of the woods, in our view. Repair, recovery, and rollout of 5G will take time to fructify and will be crucial to an improvement in its outlook,"" it said.

""The significant amount of cash required to service debt leaves limited upside opportunities for equity holders, even with the potential operating leverage benefits from any increase in ARPU. Given the current low EBITDA, servicing the debt without external funding will be challenging,"" Motilal Oswal has said.

Too big to fail
Vodafone Idea's nearly 22 crore subscriber base makes it too big to fail. Failure of Vodafone will be devastating for India's telecom sector as a whole because Jio and Airtel don’t have the capacity to absorb such a huge subscriber base. This will constrain their infrastructure and worsen service and quality standards. A duopoly in the sector could also lead to rising tariffs. That's why it is vital for Vodafone Idea to survive its multifaceted crisis.

Besides the Rs 45,000 capital injection, the telco would need strategic nimbleness, government encouragement and lots of luck. Improving its competitiveness and stepping into the 5G segment should enable it to return to a growth trajectory in terms of subscriber additions, Nomura has said.

How dark stores are powering quick commerce's rise,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 08:22:00 AM IST","The old building on Bengaluru’s busy Richmond Road had a quaint charm despite the relentless traffic. The occupancy level was low compared with the average trend in the area and next door was a legacy Raj bungalow that added to the serene tone. But all that changed when the basement got a new occupant.

At any given point of time a dozen or more youngsters were milling about, e-bikes zoomed in and out of the building, and suddenly the basement had more activity than all the other four floors combined. Just that no one quite knew what all the chaos was about.

It was a Q-com company, or quick commerce firm, that had set up its dark store. At the heart of the ‘quick’ behind this new form of commerce are these micro warehouses that have mushroomed all over urban commercial centres. Operated by players such as Zomato’s Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Bigbasket’s BB Now, they house a limited number of high-frequency use products.

Also read | The 10-minute challenge: Quick-commerce becomes the villain for neighbourhood kirana stores

A small, yet nimble, group of employees ensures that orders are packed, dispatched and delivered in a matter of minutes. And then those riders on e-bikes—many of them helmetless and not too mindful of traffic rules—swarm the place. It’s all to do with speed you see.

Modus Operandi

As per industry insiders, dark store employees can take as little as 15 seconds to pick and pack an item. ET visited a Blinkit dark store in Noida in the National Capital Region to see how this works. As soon as a customer places an order, the nearest dark store is notified.

The team lead who manages the store sends the list to a colleague. He packs the items and brings them to the counter.

Simultaneously, the team lead also sends this order to a QR code at the entrance. A delivery partner waiting in a queue outside scans the QR code. He gets to know what’s in the order as well as the delivery location. The delivery partner cross-checks the items packed and leaves for the destination.

The customer is notified and given an estimate of the delivery time. Once the package delivered, the delivery partner swipes the ‘delivered’ tab on the app to indicate the task has been completed.

Such stores are owned and managed by franchisee partners. The fleet of riders could be managed by either the franchisee partner or the quick commerce company. They are usually gig workers who are not there for the long haul. The design of the dark store itself helps shave off precious seconds from the packing time.

“The most frequently ordered items such as bread, eggs, milk and dairy products are stored right up front,” said Pravesh Singh, who manages a Zepto dark store in East Delhi. “We have five stores in a radius of 4-5 km in a Gurgaon locality. This means that the store gets closer to a customer. We have primary stores, secondary stores… which move de-pending on factors such as traffic movement during evening hours,” Blinkit’s Dhindsa said.

Quick commerce companies also study weather patterns and road conditions to determine what the fastest routes to a particular destination will be. Access control platforms such as Mygate and Nobroker work with delivery companies to allow for quicker permissions to delivery executives. “If there are multiple access points to a building, we study which particular gate will provide faster access to which block, and guide delivery partners accordingly,” a Gurgaon-based executive at one of the firms said on condition of anonymity.

Gig Challenges

Payments to delivery partners have been a sore spot for the quick commerce industry since inception. These gig workers, contracted by the companies directly for their franchisee-owned dark stores, have often complained of poor work conditions and low incomes.

In April last year, thousands of Blinkit delivery partners went on a strike after the company changed its payment structure. It moved from a fixed fee of Rs 25 per order plus Rs 7 during rush hour to a Rs 15 per order fixed fee and a distance-based component. The strike in Delhi-NCR went on for more than a week, hitting the firm hard in its biggest market.

Noida-based delivery partner Raja Sheikh said that there are additional incentives on days like New Year Eve when there are a higher number of orders. “Otherwise, the payout after a 15-hour workday is around Rs 500-600 before all costs. If you deliver 25 orders during peak hours, then there is additional incentive,” he said.

Is work-life balance sheet in the red?,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 07:31:00 AM IST","The perennial question - how much is too much - is being raised in the context of executive health and well-being this time, in the aftermath of Zerodha cofounder Nithin Kamath's revelation that he recently suffered a mild stroke. In today's high-endurance corporate culture, where the messaging is all about constantly pushing yourself - at work and outside of it - Kamath's post has spurred soul-searching on how to be well, not just fit.

""What we need to understand is, is not wellness,"" says Dr Girish B Navasundi, director of cardiology at , Bengaluru. ""People tend to associate someone who's very fit with absolutely no disease, or as someone with no vulnerabilities. This is a mindset we need to change.""

A high-intensity lifestyle, whether emotional, physical or intellectual, increases vulnerability to sudden events. ""The current in pursuit of over-performance increases the risk of injury - be it emotional or organ-specific - the most common being , stroke, premature onset of hypertension and diabetes,"" he said.

For Agilitas Sports chief executive and cofounder Abhishek Ganguly, himself a fitness aficionado, what Kamath underwent was a reminder that the human body cannot be predicted. Factors such as lack of sleep and over-working also need to be considered while trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. ""I know Nithin and I'm aware of how seriously he took fitness, and the culture of fitness he nurtured at Zerodha,"" he says.


“It was something I did at Puma, too. But this is a reminder that I might not be ticking all the boxes,” says Ganguly, who is former managing director. If a company is building a culture based on holistic fitness, for instance, “Are we checking on each other if we are getting seven hours of sleep?”

In his post on X, Kamath, 44, attributed the stroke to “Dad passing away, poor sleep, exhaustion, dehydration and over-working out —any of these could be possible reasons.”

Doctors say lack of sleep is often something people overlook.

“If someone wants to be fit, they should do it at a time when it does not compromise on their sleep,” says Dr Srinivasa Prasad BV, senior consultant of interventional cardiology at Hospital. “If you hit the gym by cutting back on your sleep, you’re straining your body in two ways: You’re already sleep-deprived and you’re putting your body under stress.”

When we don’t sleep well, our body releases stress hormones called cortisol. This can lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, the heart and, subsequently, to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, says Dr Khushbu Goel, consultant neurologist, Manipal Hospital.

The social media-fuelled obsession to pursue a certain kind of body shape does not help either, say doctors. “People are more concerned about their physique these days, and exercise with the idea of looking a certain way, without realising the need to do it through a proper channel and after a medical test,” says Dr Prasad.

As with everything else, the key, they say, is moderation — whether in the office or the gym.

“When it comes to being professionally driven, there has to be a limit. You can’t be working 16-18 hours a day, seven days a week. The desire to stay at the top will come at a cost when multiple things are intense,” says Dr Navasundi. “Disease manifests due to imbalance between wear and tear and regeneration, especially for young people.”",The economic times
Janus Henderson trims Indian stock bets to chase ‘value’ in Korea,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 08:34:00 AM IST","Janus Henderson Investors has trimmed some of its exposure to Indian stocks in favor of South Korea on expectations of higher dividend returns.

“We have taken a reasonable amount off the total India allocation as we don’t want to miss out on the value rally in Korea,” Sat Duhra, a Singapore-based portfolio manager, said in an interview. South Korea’s high dividend yields and corporate reforms are seen boosting returns, he said.

South Korean authorities unveiled a “Corporate Value-Up Program” on Monday that seeks to incentivize companies that will prioritize shareholder returns. Korea’s Kospi benchmark offers a dividend yield of 2.45% based on one-year forward earnings, higher than the 1.5% yield offered by India’s Nifty 50 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Foreigners have plowed $7.7 billion into Korean stocks this year, more than any other emerging Asian markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They withdrew more than $3 billion from Indian stocks in the period.

Still, Duhra sees India as a “superior” macro-economic theme in comparison to any other Asian market, and said he will continue to keep his exposure to sectors such as utilities, information technology and banks.

We “just felt that if we’re going to play the dividends and reform theme, then we might as well do it in Korea, where the next six-to-12 months are far more compelling,” he said.

Get into consumer stocks; 2 stocks to buy as metals in a very sweet spot: Sanjiv Bhasin,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:39:00 AM IST","Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says “it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. We think the real income is going to be generated now from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where we are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.”

Bhasin also says “metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.”

Some of the consumer appliances companies, air-conditioner companies have had a very rough patch in the last few months. Voltas, Blue Star have come back. I would like to just bring to your notice a commentary coming in from one of the leading players last evening, which is Godrej Appliances. Yesterday, they said they are expecting 20% growth in the appliances business, including air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc, going into summer. If Godrej has visibility of 20% in appliances, it will surely rub off on the entire sector. Anything which you like there and what is your take on this commentary?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been stating that this is the time to be in consumer goods, whether white goods, staples, or even discretionary. Discretionary has outperformed as you are aware of two-wheeler and four-wheeler, but staples have hardly performed. So, we have been upbeat on Bata, Patanjali. We also own both Havells and Voltas and we think that the real income which is going to be generated now is from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where you are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.

Everyone has moved on to the AC market. And with the advent of lower inflation, lower rates, I think rural India is going to be the one where money is going to be made. So, it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. If you are looking forward to the next six months, anticipation of that sale starts from now. The Godrej commentary is a very big positive from one of the big players in this industry.

Any thoughts on these two, Indostar and IB Housing?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We put our money in IB Housing at Rs 115, 120 when there was no promoter over there with more than 1% holding. Only institutions owned it and it was available almost for free and pessimism was at its highest as the old owners, Banga and the rest of them, had all exited. That was a time you should have been in this stock because the valuation comfort was at 0.4, 0.3 times price to book. Now, all those have made a comeback because NBFC has actually upped the ante and like you pointed out, the industry average is at 1.5, 1.7.

The risk to reward was very favourable and now there is a transition with a new name and new promoters. We did invest, but we have booked out of that. We are now invested in Indiabulls Real Estate, where Embassy’s takeover and the merger is just on the anvil. NCLT will give it by the middle of March and that could be a game changer.

You can imagine what Rs 6,000 crore market cap means for one of the largest marquee builder of property in both Maharashtra and Delhi and I think that Indiabulls Real Estate can be a big game changer here. It also trades at a market cap closer to Rs 5,000, 6,000 crore against even defaulters like Unitech and Parsvnath which have Rs 4,000-5,000 crore market cap. So, risk-reward is very favourable there. Indiabulls Housing Finance is going to be a game changer because of the new structure and over a period of time, it will deliver very good results. A disclosure, Indiabulls Real Estate is where we are very-very bullish.

What is happening to the overall airport economy? Today as well Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on DreamFolks and they are suggesting a target price which is almost 30% to 35% higher than the current market price. Do you think that the entire aviation, hospitality sector, DreamFolks, GMR Airports, have further room on the upside?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I used to stick my neck out because I travel so much pan-India that at 35, I used to say on TV khade honi ki jagha nahi hai airport pe, kaise GMR 35 rupaiya hai?( There’s no place to stand in the airport and GMR share price is Rs 35?). And lo and behold, look at the unlocking of the value. Aerocity is doing rocking business as far as the hotel business goes. They are selling more Black Label than ever. When luxury turns into necessity, then there is no stopping barrier for the expansion on the upside. Go to any airport, in the Bombay Airport Terminal 2, there is a one hour waiting list just to get through.

So, I think this is there to stay. You have to catch on to the right themes which you want to play. I will also take a word, you were mentioning on Vedanta, yesterday I was there at their presentation. The presentation was superb as far as both the non-ferrous and ferrous side.

People are not aware, but in India the largest nickel producer and the only nickel producer is Vedanta. From BALCO, there is aluminium, there is zinc from Hindustan Zinc. You name the product on the non-ferrous side, it is there. Aside from that, there is thermal power, there is gas, and there is energy. So, sum of the parts, the management has clearly indicated that they are not going to raise anything on the company as far as debt goes, they are only going to reduce that.

If there is going to be value unlocking as per the plan and if you gave even 50% of that, then the valuation of the stock is so cheap that at Rs 99,000 crore market cap, this can even double and still look cheap. All we need is execution and going ahead on the promise which they have made in the presentation yesterday. As a disclosure, Vedanta is also under our coverage. We think metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.

This morning, Mr Khara of SBI spoke to our colleagues that capacity utilisation across industries is now hitting the 75% mark or thereabout, that is exactly the level from which on green shoots of actual capex enquiries start coming in. He was very confident of 14% to 15% credit growth. SBI was the last mover in banks but has done pretty well. Would you latch on to SBI or some of the big PSU banks like BOB, Can Bank?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We had all of them, PNB, Can Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, part of it in our portfolio, part we booked. But we are more bullish on the private banks, the comfort of earnings, the comfort of CASA ratio and the credit expansion. The liability franchise is just a matter. So, HDFC, Axis, ICICI are our top holdings now and we continue to do SIPs on those. I will go by Mr Khara's word, but SBI has already made a first mover to 750, whereas HDFC and ICICI, Axis are now rearing to go.

I would say private banks will lead the Bank Nifty and I would be more overweight on the private banks. Also, I wish you well in your journey on the voyage on the ship. As a disclosure, ABSL AMC has been under my coverage on your channel from 350-400. Yesterday, it hit a high of 529. Do not sell it till it hits 750, that is my advice to investors.

But otherwise, what will happen is that sure fundamentals will turn around, but the stocks have already discounted that by valuations getting pushed up towards the end of calendar 23. Stock performance will remain a little anaemic which underpins our underweight IT call.”

How do you see the market breadth as well as the market movement as of now because on the index level, what we are seeing today is purely an expiry play. Do you believe that the longer term trend, which is a bull run of course, is there and we are looking out for good gains there?
Seshadri Sen: Our view is that we are going to see moderate gains, especially in the larger cap space in this calendar year. We have a Nifty target of 24,000, which is about 9% upside from current levels. We have also additionally said that in the first quarter you will see volatility so days like this will happen because we entered the quarter with a very strong run up in the October-December quarter before this.

Therefore, you are going to see a little bit of volatility and sideways movement in the broader indices in the first part of the year. Most of this 9% return will be punched towards the middle of the year, between April and September, when we have multiple triggers. You will see the election results. You are going to see the budget by the new government in July. We are still pencilling in a rate cut in some time in that period as well. All of this will come in and then the returns will start to peter out towards the end of the year. We are not surprised that we are seeing a little bit of volatility in the first quarter that is broadly what we expected. We remain constructive and positive on the broader markets in India. But we think most of the returns will come after April.

What I can say is that you remain underweight in the IT space. Just a couple of days back, we had some brokerages which are still bullish on the IT space and specifically willing to be with the leaders. How do you see the construct of the IT space as of now because just in the last earnings, we have seen a lot of stocks and the analysts getting back to their confidence levels in the IT space that maybe it is the time to accumulate the IT space? But what is your rationale?
Seshadri Sen: In IT, one has to look at it in two parts. So first is fundamentals, IT is going through a cyclical downturn at the moment. But we expect that if the US economy stays strong and or if there are rate cuts in the middle of the year by the Fed, you will see a recovery in the overall growth dynamics for IT towards the end of the year.

We are not too worried about the current cyclical downturn. However, we have seen, especially in the post-Covid period, that most of the money in IT is made when the valuations change. The long-term compounding of earnings in that sector is not particularly exciting. It is a great sector. It is growing very well. It throws out a lot of cash.

But you make money when the valuation changes. So, we will be overweight IT when valuations revert back to our side when the large caps maybe touch the low 20s or even below. But otherwise, we think that what will happen is that sure fundamentals will turn around, but the stocks have already discounted that by valuations getting pushed up towards the end of calendar 23. Stock performance will remain a little anaemic which underpins our underweight IT call.

Since 24,000 is what you are eyeing for Nifty 50, which sectors do you believe will lead Nifty to those levels? Which sectors are you still bullish on?
Seshadri Sen: The two sectors that we really like are a manufacturing-led cycle for India. So, by and large, we think manufacturing will outperform services. And within that, we are industrials, consumer, discretionary, and materials are three sectors that we like.

Consumer discretionary, especially since I think autos and auto ancillaries are almost 60% of that sector if you look at Nifty, if I remember right. And that is one area overall that we like. We know autos and auto ancillaries that will lead. Industrials and materials is the other way to play the manufacturing cycle. We think that services like financial services and IT will lag this bull market. We have already seen some of that happen, and that will continue in the medium term.

"ICICI Bank branch manager forged signatures, siphoned off 'Rs 11.95 crore' by transfer and cash, alleges the customer; case in EOW's net","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:52:00 PM IST","The branch manager of an ICICI Bank branch has admitted having committed fraud by forging the signature of an NRI customer. In a complaint letter dated January 6, 2024, to Vikas Puri Police Station in Delhi, ICICI Bank said, ""It is pertinent to mention that the overdraft facility (amounting to Rs 2.7 crore) was created by Varun Vashishta, Branch manager, ICICI Bank Vikas Puri Branch by forging signature of customer on overdraft account opening form. Further it was found that a total amount of Rs 2.68 crore siphoned off from the account.""

The bank had urged via this letter to the police to register an FIR in this case. While the initial amount of fraud was estimated to be around Rs 2.68 crore, further investigation by the complainant bank revealed that the overall amount of fraud could be close to Rs 12 crore. This amount could go up further to around Rs 16 crore if the interest amount is also included. It is being alleged that the fraud started in 2019 and only recently came to light when the victim NRI customer of the bank complained about this embezzlement.

Where did the bank branch manager syphon off money from the customer's a/c to?
According to the complaint filed by the victim NRI customer dated January 29, 2024 addressed to Economic Offences Wing (EOW), 43 beneficiaries were identified till date who had received money at various times from the NRE bank account of the complainant without authorisation. She further alleged that cash to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore was withdrawn from her account over the years and about Rs 9.5 crore was transferred to the said 43 beneficiaries.

Why did such a scam go unnoticed for years?
The complainant's husband runs a hotel in Delhi and a point-of-sale machine (POS), and the current account of the said hotel were held at this branch of ICICI Bank. The complainant claimed that money was being deposited regularly in an NRE bank account held at the Vikaspuri branch of ICICI Bank since 2019.

The victim NRI customer revealed in the letter to the EOW that fixed deposit (FD) receipts were handed over by the ICICI Bank manager of Vikas Puri branch, with the stamp of ICICI Bank, and it was also emailed from the official Email ID of the bank branch manager. ""We never visited the bank branch nor suspected the FDs to be fraudulent since the bank's branch manager used to visit us in our home and handover the FD receipts and also emailed the same receipts with the bank's seal from the bank's official email ID. These FD receipts and interest certificates were forged which we recently learned. I recently learned that my account was being managed by ICICI Bank Gurgaon branch whereas I was under the impression that my bank account was being managed by ICICI Bank Vikaspuri branch. No official from the ICICI Bank Gurgaon branch ever contacted me,"" said the complainant exclusively To ET Online when asked.

Bank says it's difficult for things to remain unnoticed for long
In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for ICICI Bank has said, ""The Bank has consistently sent transaction details to her registered mobile number and email id since the accounts were opened a few years ago. It is bewildering that the customer claims to be unaware of these transactions and balances in her account over the past three years, and she only recently noticed a discrepancy in her account balance. This discrepancy ought to have been observed by the customer when filing Income Tax returns (ITR) as well.""

ITR may not necessarily compel customer to check FD details
Customers don't need to check NRE FD details at the time of filing ITR because interest earned on NRE deposits are exempted from income tax. ""Unlike a normal resident bank account fixed deposit (FDs) of where Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is deducted if interest on FD exceeds Rs 40,000 a year (in case of Senior Citizen limit is Rs 50,000), in NRE bank accounts, no TDS is deducted however much the amount of interest is. This is because it is exempt from income tax,"" says chartered accountant Mihir Tanna, associate director, S.K. Patodia LLP, a CA firm.

Branch manager changed mobile number and email address
The aggrieved customer alleged that she received certain notifications/email alerts about cash withdrawals made in her bank account. However, when she confronted the ICICI Bank branch manager about these alerts, he dismissed these 'notification alerts' from ICICI Bank as fraudulent phishing emails and to not open them further. In the letter to EOW, the complainant said, ""I used to immediately inform Mr. Varun Vashisht on phone and WhatsApp about such alerts. However, every time I informed Mr. Varun Vashishta about any such notification, he warned that these were 'fraud phishing' mails which many customers are getting and was asked not to click or open any such email.""

Responding to these allegations, the spokesperson for ICICI Bank said, ""She alleges that the mobile number and email ID of her account were changed without her knowledge. However, our records indicate that notifications regarding both changes were sent to her original mobile number and email address which were registered with the Bank. Furthermore, the new number is listed on the website of a company owned by the customer herself.""

What did ICICI Bank do after being informed about the scam?
The spokesperson for ICICI Bank said, ""As an aggrieved party, we have lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EoW) of Delhi Police for a thorough investigation into the matter. We are extending full cooperation to the Police investigation. We have communicated to the customer that we are ready to transfer the disputed amount of Rs 9.27 crore (she has already encashed a fixed deposit of Rs 2 crore) to her account with a lien, pending the outcome of the investigation (by EOW).""

The case, which was first investigated by the Vikas Puri Police Station in Delhi, has now been transferred to the EOW. ET Online tried getting the initial views of the EOW officials investigating the matter, however, they did not want to comment on any ongoing investigation and hence, refrained from giving a statement about the case.

Claims by the victim and counter-claims by the bank have increased the complication of the issue and only a thorough investigation will reveal the truth.",The economic times

There have been widespread media speculation that Michelle Obama is poised to enter the 2024 Presidential Election arena and potentially face off against former US President Donald Trump.

In January, Michelle Obama had expressed fear about the 2024 election and said that it 'haunts' her sleep. She said she was terrified that Donald Trump would win.

""What's going to happen in this next election? I'm terrified about what could possibly happen, because our leaders matter,"" Michelle had said in a podcast interview last month.

Separately, there has been a surge of speculation regarding Biden's future within the party, following a damning report by special counsel Robert Hur. The report characterised the president as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.""

Pause in repo rate hike has boosted homebuyers' sentiment
The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) last increased the repo rate, by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.5%, in February 2023. Since then, the central bank has kept the repo rate unchanged. Home buyers were adversely affected with an overall hike of 2.5% on their home loans and were waiting for the interest rate to fall. However, back-to-back pause in the repo rate for the last year, the sentiment of homebuyers, said many experts. ""This is a win-win situation for both builders and buyers,"" said Rohan Khatau, Director of CCI Projects. “For builders, it means more liquidity and lower financing costs. For buyers, it ensures that home loans remain affordable.”

Samyak Jain, Director of Siddha Group, said, ""Homebuyers stand to benefit from this decision as it implies stable loan interest rates. The unchanged policy rates mean that the cost of borrowing will not increase, making it an opportune time for potential homeowners to secure loans at attractive rates.""",The economic times
Govt plans to feed poll campaign with its Bharat staples,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:18:00 AM IST","New Delhi: The government is looking at ways to give a big push to its Bharat staples brand, under which it sells atta, rice and pulses in the retail market at subsidised rates, ahead of the general elections in April-May.

""The plan is to carpet bomb Bharat brand products in every assembly constituency before the elections,"" said a senior official aware of the government's plan, adding that the mandate is to take it to as many consumers as possible.

The three agencies - Kendriya Bhandar, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) - through which the Bharat products are sold have been asked to sell 300,000-400,000 metric tonnes of rice and atta every month, said the people cited above. Equal emphasis has to be given to pulses also, they added.

The retail prices of several essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses, onions, tomatoes soared last year due to reduced production.



Cheer for Farmers and Consumers
This kept food inflation elevated throughout the year, following which the government started selling these products in the retail market.

While it began selling chana dal at a subsidised rate in July 2023 under Bharat brand when retail prices of tur (arhar) rose sharply, Bharat Atta was launched in November 2023 and Bharat Rice in February 2024 to contain prices.

Products under the Bharat brand are priced significantly lower than those of others. For instance, Bharat Rice is sold at ₹29 per kg while other branded rice is sold at ₹40 to ₹110 per kg.

Similarly, Bharat Atta and Bharat Chana Dal are sold at ₹27.5 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. Other branded atta is sold for over Rs 40 a kg and chana dal at over Rs 100 a kg.

The sale of these products will be augmented by offering them on ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, BigBasket, Flipkart, ONDC and in modern trade stores such as Reliance Fresh, More etc., an official said.

"'Unacceptable, we were wrong"": Under-fire Google CEO Pichai reacts to Gemini AI fall-out","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:47:00 AM IST","Following severe backlash from communities across various social media platforms regarding Gemini, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly addressed the issue and said that the problematic responses around race were ""unacceptable"".

The Google CEO addressed these concerns via a memo, as per Semafor.

""Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We’re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts,” he said.

""No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we’ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale,"" he reportedly said.

ETOnline has not independently verified this information.

Google Gemini controversy
Google has been on the receiving end of severe backlash following certain responses from its AI outlet which has reportedly shown racial bias, among other problematic issues. In one case, it even said that ""It is not possible to say who definitively impacted society more, Elon (Musk) tweeting memes or Hitler,"" the AI software said in its response.

This controversy has prompted the question of the risks of AI when programmed with a bias, given how quickly it is permeating our day to day lives.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Elon Musk accused Google of running a ""racist, anti-civilisational programming"" with its AI models. ""Google Gemini is super racist and sexist. This just shows more and more how Gemini is programmed with the exact same narratives that our higher education teaches.""

Alphabet's Google began offering image generation through its Gemini AI models earlier this month. Some users, however, flagged on social media that it generated historical images which were sometimes inaccurate. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software to rival that of the Microsoft-backed company.

Bard was renamed Gemini earlier this month and Google rolled out paid subscription plans, which users could choose for better reasoning capabilities from the AI model.

“It’s clear that this feature missed the mark,” said a blog post Friday from Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president who runs Google’s search engine and other businesses. ""Some of the images generated are inaccurate or even offensive. We’re grateful for users’ feedback and are sorry the feature didn’t work well,

Google added the new image-generating feature to its Gemini chatbot, formerly known as Bard, about three weeks ago. It was built atop an earlier Google research experiment called Imagen 2.

Google has known for a while that such tools can be unwieldly. In a 2022 technical paper, the researchers who developed Imagen warned that generative AI tools can be used for harassment or spreading misinformation “and raise many concerns regarding social and cultural exclusion and bias.” Those considerations informed Google’s decision not to release “a public demo” of Imagen or its underlying code, the researchers added at the time.

Sebi directs mutual funds to protect smallcap investors from market froth,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:31:00 PM IST","Leading to a sell-off in small, midcap, and microcap stocks on Wednesday, markets regulator Sebi has told mutual funds (MFs) to frame a policy to protect the interest of investors in small and midcap schemes.

In a letter to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), Sebi said in the context of froth building up in small and midcap segments of the market and the continuing flows in the small and midcap schemes of mutual funds, trustees, in consultation with Unitholder Protection Committees of AMCs, shall ensure that a policy is put in place to protect the interest of all investors.

In the letter, Sebi said that AMCs should take appropriate and proactive measures to protect investors, including but not limited to moderating inflows, portfolio rebalancing, etc.

Steps should also be taken to ensure that investors are protected from the first mover advantage of redeeming investors, it said while directing that the policy should be approved and disclosed on each AMC's website within the next 3 weeks.

The regulator's directive, which was communicated to all MF houses, sparked selling pressure in the market with the Sensex falling over 800 points while Nifty also fell 1% to give its hold on the 22,000-level.

Indices related to smallcap, midcaps and microcaps fell over 2% as Sebi's directive may reduce the pace of flow of funds in the broader market.



In the last year, smaller stocks have led the upside on Dalal Street to make the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks closer to the $5 trillion mark. Nifty Microcap 250 index has almost doubled in valued in the last 12 months. Nifty Smallcap 50 is up 77% and Nifty Midcap50 has rallied 62% during the period vs Nifty's 26% gain.

Value investors have been warning against the froth building up in smaller stocks as retail investors are betting directly on (without figuring out PE or PB levels) as well as through smallcap MFs.

""Retail investors’ ownership of the smallcap segment has also become sizeable, crossing even institutional ownership in many stocks. Institutional investors, like mutual funds, exercise broad controls and invest in a disciplined manner. However, momentum chasing by investors, coupled with limited free float available in the market, has created valuation distortions in a few cases. Such experience is further boosting investors’ confidence, over-shadowing the caution required,"" Kotak Mutual Fund said.

Kotak had recently announced that it will restrict flows into its smallcap scheme from March 4. The fund house said fresh subscriptions through lumpsums will be restricted for each investor to Rs 2 lakh per month while SIPs are limited to Rs 25,000 per month.

Various fund houses like , Tata and Nippon do not accept lumpsum investments in their smallcap schemes.

“In my opinion there is a strong possibility that many funds will be influenced to halt for some time from accepting lump sum investments in these segments. SIP flows shouldn’t be impacted,” Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research said.

Analysts suggest keeping a moderate overweight stance on largecap stocks, equal weight on midcap stocks, and moderate underweight on .

""Nita Ambani and Uday Shankar will be the chairperson and vice chairperson of the merged entity,"" said one of the persons cited above. The person added that Shankar is likely to be Reliance's nominee on the merged entity's board.

The sole board seat given to Bodhi Tree is likely to be taken up by its investor, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the person said.

INQ Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QIA, had last year invested in Bodhi Tree Systems.

Both Reliance and Disney have set an ambitious deadline for completing the merger by October, another person stated.

However, legal experts cautioned that the completion of the merger will depend on the time it takes to receive Competition Commission of India (CCI) clearance. ""Most merger deals have a two- to three-year sunset clause. This will be no different,"" the person cited above said.

People earlier told ET that Reliance may own 61% of the proposed combined company, with Disney holding 33% and Bodhi Tree having the remaining 6%.

How Ram Lalla helped BJP win Uttar Pradesh Rajya Sabha elections,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:33:00 PM IST","The victory of Sanjay Seth, the eighth candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Rajya Sabha elections held in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, can be attributed to the support of Ram Lalla. Despite facing challenges, the BJP managed to secure the votes of seven Samajwadi Party (SP) MLAs, which played a crucial role in Seth's win. Seth received 29 first preference votes, while SP's candidate Alok Ranjan only received 19 votes.

The BJP's strategy to identify these seven SP legislators was a joint effort by key government figures, including Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and ministers Suresh Khanna and JPS Rathore. State party chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and general secretary (organisation) Dharampal were also involved in the process.

The task was simplified as the BJP focused on SP MLAs who had openly supported the consecration of Ram Lalla's idol at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22. A BJP leader stated, 'We approached those MLAs who had strongly supported the consecration event, despite the party's silence on the issue. Many of them responded positively.'

Rakesh Pratap Singh, Abhay Singh, Vinod Chaturvedi, and Manoj Pandey were among the identified SP legislators. After the announcement of the RS election results, Abhay Singh tweeted, 'Voting was conducted transparently. We voted according to our will.

"DMK newspaper ad shows 'China rocket': PM Modi slams party, says 'insulted scientists'","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 05:10:00 PM IST","A controversy has erupted over a newspaper advertisement in Tamil Nadu. The advertisement, featuring images of both Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister M K Stalin, prominently displays a rocket in the background. This has sparked a debate as one of the rockets in the image bears a Chinese flag on its nose cone, while the others display Chinese characters.

The ad was allegedly issued by the minister for fisheries and animal husbandry Anitha R Radhakrishnan on Wednesday ahead of the inauguration of a new launch complex at Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin district by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Meanwhile, PM Modi lashed out on the DMK govt at the state saying that the ad insulted Indian scientists and is a waste of public money.

""DMK is a party that does not work but stands ahead to take false credit. These people paste their stickers on our schemes. Now they have crossed the limits, they have pasted China's sticker to take credit for the ISRO launch pad in Tamil Nadu,"" PM Modi said while addressing a gathering in Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu.

The Prime Minister alleged that the DMK is 'not ready' to accept India's progress in the space sector.

""They are not ready to accept India's progress in the space sector and with the taxes that you pay, they give advertisements and do not even include a picture of India's space in it. They did not want to present India's space success in front of the world, they insulted our scientists, our space sector, and your tax money. Now it's high time that the DMK is punished for their deeds,"" PM Modi said.


DMK MP K Kanimozhi, however, defended the party. ""I don't know from where the person who did the artwork found this picture,"" Kanimozhi said while speaking to reporters outside Chennai airport on Wednesday. ""I don't think India has declared China an enemy country. I have seen that the Prime Minister has invited the Chinese PM and they have gone to Mahabalipuram. Just because you do not want to accept the truth, you are finding reasons to divert the issue,"" the DMK leader said.


Earlier, Modi also lashed out at the Congress and DMK and accused the alliance parties of engaging in 'dividing' the nation.

""India celebrated the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. A few days ago, a resolution was moved in Parliament regarding the same. All the members of DMK left the house. This behaviour shows how much the DMK leaders despise your faith,"" he said.

""DMK and Congress are hell-bent on dividing the nation. Whereas, the BJP considers every person a family member,"" the Prime Minister said.

He expressed confidence that people in the state look up to BJP for development.

""Children, old people, youth, women, poor and middle class, every section, every society of Tamil Nadu is coming with BJP with full confidence today. People of Tamil Nadu are looking at BJP with great hopes. People are seeing how BJP has taken forward the positive politics of sensitivity and social justice in the country,"" he said.

""This immense love and trust of Tamil Nadu is a big responsibility for us. People see how the BJP has promoted the positive politics of sensitivity and social justice. I guarantee you, the BJP will leave no stone unturned to rise up to your expectations,"" PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister highlighted the proposal for AIIMS to be built in Madurai while accusing the state government of 'non-cooperation.'

""Today, if the country moves forward 100 steps, then Tamil Nadu should also move forward with the same speed, this is Modi's resolve. Therefore, if we have opened many new AIIMS in the country in the last 10 years, then we are going to open AIIMS in Madurai also,"" he said.

""Today, if every poor person in the country is getting guaranteed free treatment up to Rs five lakh, then more than 50 lakh beneficiaries are our brothers and sisters from Tamil Nadu. And we are doing this service when there is a government in the state which is not ready to cooperate with us even for the interest of Tamil Nadu,"" PM Modi outlined.

He also criticised the DMK government of standing against development of the state while vowing to return to power on them.

""Therefore, you all need to be alert from the state government that is opposed to the development of Tamil Nadu and such anti-development political parties and now demand an account from them,"" he said.

Congress-Left allies in different states but will oppose each other in Kerala: Jairam Ramesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:47:00 PM IST","With the CPI declaring Annie Raja its candidate from Kerala's Wayanad, the Congress Wednesday said it is in alliance with the Left in different states but they have always and will continue to oppose each other electorally in Kerala. The Congress's assertion came after Annie Raja, wife of CPI general secretary D Raja, was nominated to contest from the pivotal Wayanad constituency, a seat presently held by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

Asked about Annie Raja's candidature, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh told reporters, ""The Left parties are very much part of the INDIA group. It has always been understood that this does not preclude group partners from contesting against each other in different states especially Kerala.""

""The Congress and the Left are allies in different states but in Kerala we have always and will continue to oppose each other electorally,"" he asserted.

Blow-off rallies in individual segments once complete should lead to a prolonged market correction: Rohit Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:19:00 PM IST","Rohit Srivastava, Strike Money Analytics & Indiacharts, says “almost Rs 50,000 crore of that just got added in the last one month. This is huge, it is probably one of the largest futures expiry that we are seeing happening right now, which is probably one of the reasons why there is some pressure because there is a very huge rollover that has to happen and we will see how that goes. But the very size of the positioning is a risk to the market itself.”

Does it seem there are some signs of consolidation currently in the market or do you expect this to reverse and the market could even claim new highs even going forward now?
Rohit Srivastava: No, I do not think this is a routine correction or consolidation. I think that this is a topping process of the market. This is the third attempt that the Nifty has made since January to go above 22,130. It failed the first and the second time. The third time we did see it close above that for a couple of days and again we are below that.

Now, of course, the final confirmation to what I am seeing will come if it breaks the 20-day average as well, which is at 21,950. But the setup looks like a slow and steady distribution happening during this time period because different sectors are weakening from time to time and starting to decline.

We have seen some sectors outperform during the one, one-and-a-half month period, but I think that has not really led to the Nifty taking off which is basically a sign that these are last flash rallies, blow off rallies in individual segments that are happening, which once complete should lead to a much more prolonged corrective phase or correction in the market, which has not happened in quite a while. That is what we are looking for. It is something a little more reasonable in terms of correction.

So, not much of an excitement that you are expecting, at least from the next series, that is the March series?
Rohit Srivastava: No, I do not think so because we have seen two months of strong upticks. Positioning is very high. If you have actually looked at the futures open interest, it touched Rs 4,08,000 crore. That is the total stock and index futures combined yesterday, that is almost 18 times the value of the index. Now, when was the last time we had 18 times the value of the index in stock and index futures? The answer is somewhere between December and Jan of 2008.

So, that is the significance of how much position people have taken. In fact, almost Rs 50,000 crore of that just got added in the last one month. This is huge, it is probably one of the largest futures expiry that we are seeing happening right now, which is probably one of the reasons why there is some pressure because there is a very huge rollover that has to happen and we will see how that goes. But the very size of the positioning is a risk to the market itself.

Stock specific, have you looked into Max Financial’s chart? It is one of the top F&O gainers in trade today and the stock seems to have taken support around its 100 DMA. How is that stock looking like?
Rohit Srivastava: Not on my tracking list right now, but I would not be taking any bullish views on anything right now.

And sector specific, what we are seeing today is that the real estate sector has been one of the star performers of 2023 and of late also in 2024, the index has been running on the higher side, it is now the top loser. In fact, it is down around 2.5%. What is that sector looking like? What is that index looking like?
Rohit Srivastava: Not very great, I would say. It has had a good run. But we should have come close to ending the rally in realty stocks as well. It may not be the weakest sector, though for today it may be weak, the place people should look for weakness is where there has been the maximum weakness on a one month and a one-week basis and that would slightly point you to slightly different sectors.

For example, on a one-month basis, it is media and FMCG and on a one-week basis, it is oil and gas, Nifty Bank and those are probably places where further weakness could show up. So, we will have to really focus on those segments. But realty, as you mentioned, it does look like the best should be done for this current move.

The IT sector has been bucking that trend today. Would you rather be stock specific when it comes to the IT sector or are you bullish on the IT sector?
Rohit Srivastava: No, we are not. Slightly more medium term, I would not be very bullish on IT stocks right now. You notice that even though IT stocks have come up, they are still below the high that they made in 2022. So, it has not been a very strong move. It has been a very major attempt to come back, but not strong enough to say that they are out of the woods, which is why it is still a lot of headwinds still for IT. So, that is not a place I would want to really focus on.

"Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019: What's CAA, NRC? How it will impact and why is it seen as a problem?","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:01:00 PM IST","In 2019, widespread protests, some of them violent, erupted across India against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. This Act has once again grabbed headlines amidst reports indicating the government's intention to notify it before the Lok Sabha Elections 2024. The legislation aims to redefine the status of illegal immigrants for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, and Christian migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, who have resided in India without proper documentation. They are slated to be granted expedited Indian citizenship within six years, deviating from the previous norm of a 12-year residency requirement for naturalization.

Who comes under CAA?
Following the parliamentary approval of the CAA in December 2019 and subsequent presidential consent, demonstrations flared up in locations like Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and Assam's Guwahati. These protests, which resulted in over a hundred casualties from clashes with law enforcement or other causes, gradually waned amidst the COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown measures.

What is Centre's logic behind the CAA?
The CAA targets individuals ""forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion,"" intending to shield them from illegal migration proceedings. The cutoff date for citizenship eligibility is December 31, 2014, requiring applicants to have entered India on or before that date. Presently, Indian citizenship is granted to those born in India or who have resided in the country for a minimum of 11 years. Additionally, the proposed amendment includes a provision for the cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration if the OCI cardholder violates any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other applicable law.

CAA: Some say it is like Partition, is that true?
The government asserts that the minority groups covered by the CAA have fled persecution in Muslim-majority nations. However, critics question the consistency of this logic, highlighting the exclusion of certain religious minorities and neighboring regions facing similar issues. Despite this, the government has not provided satisfactory answers to these concerns.

How much of Northeast does the CAA cover?
While the CAA does not apply to regions under the sixth schedule of the Constitution or states with inner-line permit regimes, Assam has witnessed particularly fervent opposition. Fear persists that regularizing illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh under the CAA could threaten the cultural and linguistic fabric of the state.

Why is Assam angry about CAA?
Unlike the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which focused on identifying illegal immigrants without regard to religion, the CAA has drawn criticism for allegedly discriminating against Muslims, thus infringing upon the fundamental right to equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution. Despite opposition claims, the government maintains its stance on the legality and fairness of the CAA.

Isn't it the same like the NRC?
Although the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, received presidential assent on December 12, the Home Ministry has yet to notify the operational rules. Recent reports suggest that the government plans to finalize these rules before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.

"Russia diverts LNG supplies for Asia around Africa to avoid Red Sea, LSEG data shows","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:34:00 PM IST","Russia is diverting China-bound cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a longer route via the Cape of Good Hope due to the heightened risk of attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, LSEG data showed.

Global fuel producers, including Russia, were forced to change the way they deliver to Asia and go around Africa to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea despite the Suez canal being the shortest route between Asia and Europe.

The extended route to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope will add about 10 days to the journey, something that could worsen a shortage of tankers Russia is already facing due to Western sanctions.

According to LSEG data, tanker LNG Geneva, loaded on Jan. 3 with Russian LNG from Yamal ship-to-ship (STS) near Kildin Island in the Murmansk region was heading around Africa and unloaded on Feb. 16 at the Jieyang terminal in China.

Another tanker, Clean Vision, which was carrying Russian gas from Novatek Yamal LNG, was loaded on Jan. 17 and is heading towards China where it is expected to unload on Feb. 28.

Vessels carrying LNG from Yamal, which were loaded in December last year and delivered fuel to China via the Red Sea route are heading back around Africa, LSEG data shows.

Novatek did not respond to a Reuters request.

Novatek used to supply its LNG to Asia via the Suez Canal when navigation along the Northern Sea Route was closed during the winter months.

Russia plans to establish year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route.

In January 2024, exports from Yamal LNG have totalled about 1.8 million metric tons. That figure fell to 1.46 million metric tons in February, according to LSEG data.

Qatar, one of the world's biggest LNG exporters, informed Italy's Edison and other buyers in Europe in January that its LNG cargoes would take a longer route via the Cape of Good Hope due to the Red Sea crisis.

Byju’s US lenders invoke parent company's guarantee in insolvency proceedings,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:07:00 PM IST","The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday told Byju’s to respond to two separate insolvency petitions filed against the troubled edtech firm by US lenders and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

In the first matter, the Bengaluru bench of NCLT provided Byju’s parent Think & Learn three weeks from now to file its objections to a petition filed by Glas Trust Company LLC, the administrative agent appointed by a group of lenders that had extended a $1.2-billion term loan B to its US subsidiary Alpha Inc to collect the debt under the guarantee agreement.

The petitioner – that claims to collectively own more than 85% of the term loan B – invoked the guarantee provided by Think & Learn.

In a separate case, BCCI’s counsel on Wednesday told the Bengaluru bench of NCLT that Byju’s has not yet paid pending due of Rs 156 crore.

The counsel claimed that Byju’s had already deducted tax deducted at source (TDS) against invoices that it received from BCCI, but it never paid the invoice amount to the cricket board.

The dispute is over Byju’s team India jersey sponsorship deal signed with the Indian cricket board in 2019.

The BCCI counsel told NCLT that Byju’s had asked it to encash Rs 143 crore performance bank guarantee, which the edtech firm had provided, and said the remaining amount of Rs 156 crore will be paid later.

The tribunal on Wednesday provided time to BCCI’s counsel to file the judgments, and Byju’s counsel to file a comprehensive reply after that.

Amid a worsening business demand for players operating in the business-to-consumer K-12 business post-Covid, Byju’s has found itself in multiple tussles ranging from non-payment of several dues, employee salaries, incessant layoffs and a much-delayed reporting of its financials among other matters.

On January 25, the group of US lenders had first petitioned the bankruptcy court in India to initiate insolvency proceedings against Think & Learn, exacerbating the challenges for a company that is desperately scouting for funds to keep operations running amid a slowdown in the edtech sector and regulatory scrutiny.

The lenders have been in negotiation with the company over prepayment of a $1.2-billion term loan taken by Byju's Alpha even as the two sides also continued to fight a legal battle in US courts.

The counsel for Glas Trust told the court that Byju’s Alpha owes money to about 100 lenders.

"Himachal Pradesh Assembly Speaker suspends 15 BJP MLAs, state minister Vikramaditya Singh steps down","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 PM IST","The political drama in Himachal Pradesh took a fresh turn after state assembly speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania suspended 15 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs from the house allegedly for creating ruckus in his chamber.

The 15 BJP MLA's who were suspended from the House include Jai Ram Thakur, Vipin Parmar, Randhir Sharma, Hans Raj, Vinod Kumar, Janak Raj, Balbir Verma, Lokinder Kumar, Trilok Jamwal, Surinder Shourie, Puran Chand, Dalip Thakur, Inder Singb Gandhi, Ranbir Nikka and Deep Raj.

Meanwhile, Vikramaditya Singh, a state minister and the son of the former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh stepped down from his position, a day after the Rajya Sabha election result in the state.

""The (state) government failed to find even a small piece of land on Mall Road to install the statue of a person (Virbhadra Singh) who was the CM of Himachal Pradesh six times, because of whom this government was formed,"" he said.

He said, ""All I would like to say is that under the current circumstances, it is not correct for me to continue as a part of the government. So, I have decided that I am resigning from the Council of Ministers. I am resigning as a minister. In the time to come, I will have video consultations with my people and then decide about the future course of action...""

""For me, the most important thing is the relationship with the people of Himachal Pradesh,"" he added.

""But the kind of system prevailing in the government in last one year, how MLAs were overlooked and attempts were made to stifle their voices - this is a result of that,"" he said.

In a shocking political development in the state on Tuesday, the ruling Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi lost the Rajya Sabha election to the BJP's Harsh Mahajan despite the Congress enjoying a comfortable majority in the state assembly.

Both candidates secured 34 votes each in the 68-member state assembly.

Victory tilted towards Mahajan after a draw of lots was held as a tie-breaker.

The victory is even more detrimental in the wake of former BJP Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur's claim that the Sukhu government has been reduced to a minority in the house.

However, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi conceded his defeat and 'thanked' the MLAs who cross-voted leading to the victory of Harsh Mahajan.

""I would also like to thank the nine persons (MLAs) because they have taught me a lot about human nature, its fickleness or its resoluteness. They supped with us. So, I think we are bad judges of human character, they are obviously better judges of human character,"" he said.

Earlier, CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had claimed that opposition leaders were obstructing the work of counting officials, and that ""5-6 Congress MLAs were taken away in a convoy of the CRPF and Haryana Police.

There are lots of sectors which are trending up, which have consolidated and which are going to see the next leg up post election.

So, I do not think one has to be very scared in terms of where the market heights are or that there are so many lakhs of opportunities. The market always gives chances to invest. Market gives you chances to buy into and at the end of the day, if you are not very old, you have no choice but to buy today. Therefore, one should stay clear of mind and say past is past, the future looks good, we need to find a way to invest. How much to invest, when the timing issue is a different matter but to worry about the market is on a high, I do not think you need to be worried about it. Look at the right sectors and you should be fine.

An excellent point with age comes experience and with experience comes precision. I think this is the only game where you get better with age is it not. It is in your favour. The precision is only increasing, is it not?
Ajay Srivastava: I wish so. I wish doctors would find that they get more money as they become older. You would not find a trader in New York who is over 35 years old, by the way. In fact, we have a disadvantage because we know the history of share prices and therefore we get bogged with it. The guy in my office who just walked in this year, joins this year. He does not know what happened 15 years back and therefore he comes with no baggage.

So, to some extent, our experience, grey hair is a disadvantage. The only advantage is having seen so much, done so much. We are not scared of anything. We do not fear the market. We love and embrace the market. That is the only difference perhaps that comes with age, that you tend to know that the market will surprise you, market will over guess you, market is smarter than you and I think once the thought is in your mind, you are much better off investing.

There is a saying on the Street that there are old traders and there are bold traders but there are no old bold traders. But then Buffett made the bulk of the money after 50. So, the best of the returns are backhanded. Indian PSU stocks were never graded as investment grade. They were just point A to point B and then exit kind of plays. Over the years their business models have become more robust and efficiencies are clearly visible in numbers, but valuations did become a question mark because they shot up in a very short span of time. During 2024, if the PSUs correct, would you be comfortable getting back in there for a three- to five-year view?
Ajay Srivastava: Getting back I do not know because we are already invested in it. In some sectors, you have no choice but to go into PSUs like the defence sector. We do not have any big private defence company in this country, at least at this point of time. Some may emerge over time. Bharat Forge may come in or a smaller set up may go, but if you want to buy defence you have no choice but to buy the PSU company.

If you want to buy oil marketing companies which have a huge reach in this country, you have no choice but to buy PSUs. If you look at power stocks at this point of time, the company with the highest power capacity is a PSU stock. If you look at transmission companies, you do not have an option but to buy into a PSU transmission company because there is none which exists in the private sector.

So, the debate whether we can buy or not is not a choice if you want to be in the transmission, defence, big power and oil retailing sectors. In these four sectors, there is no choice. Yes, you have a choice to buy a PSU bank or not to buy a PSU bank, but if you look at these four-five sectors, you have no choice. My guess is that these sectors will have just seen the first run-up after almost two decades. We have seen PSUs not performing for two decades or maybe more. After the first leg, people have kind of rarely said it is the new high, but I think it will go higher.

PSUs will get more traction certainly in the five sectors we have spoken about just now because simply there is none which exists and there is no competition and anybody who wants to come into India in these five sectors has to go to the PSUs. So, my guess is that these five-six sectors including say power finance, now that is a unique niche in this country which again with the PSUs, you cannot go anywhere else, PSUs.

You want to ignore the sectors? Sure. You want to be in the sectors, PSU is your game and I think they will give much better returns because for one reason the dividend policies are now specified. So, with the dividend yield, these become very attractive buys and debt is not their concern, they are government guaranteed so they can borrow the best rates, professional management well one can say yes to some extent but OMCs would say it is not professionally managed because the rates are governed by the government at this point of time.

Having said, overall it looks positive and with the new government coming in, there will be more divestments and more accountability, boards will get professionalised. So, it is a good wicket to be in at least in the five sectors.

What are your thoughts when you compare PSU banks with private banks?
Ajay Srivastava: We do not have too many banks in our portfolio, neither in advisory at this point of time for the simple reason that these are behemoths who have lost to the competition. They did not invest enough and once the RBI removed the umbrella of no new licenses and the fintechs came in and NBFCs got a little bit of a leg-up, these banks were found wanting. Leave aside HDFC Bank where the merger was a disaster. So leave that aside, it is a good institution but it will take its own time to come up. But by and large, this is one sector which has lagged behind because when RBI gave them such a comfort of no competition, they never thought of the consumer at the end of the day and that is what fintechs came and did.

The core constituency of the banks was to keep your money cheap and lend at leisure including government securities. So, you kept your fixed deposit at 5-6%, they were putting in government treasury at 7-8%. CASA was next to nothing. I think that model is under threat at this point of time and therefore banks will see a consistent problem because their raw material, the cheap raw material, is now becoming more expensive, just like any manufacturing company. If the raw material goes up your margins tend to shrink because the customer can get his options.

So, the banks are going to have a problem with their basic raw material, cheap deposits whittling down, it cannot disappear, people love to put money in the bank but it will whittle down. Therefore, I would tend to believe that our industrial sectors, our equity linked sectors would be far better choices than banks at this point of time in terms of return on capital.

You may have observed that big money seems to be positioning in some of the very beaten down kinds of NBFCs in the last few weeks. Just yesterday, Florintree along with Brookfield decided to put in a big chunk in Indostar, the CV financier that had bombed out. Last week we saw Rs 4000 crore come in the rights issue of Indiabulls Housing. Would you be keen to look at some of these names or will you be wary of them?
Ajay Srivastava: We have moved into but very large NBFCs. We are not moving to small NBFCs and the reason we moved into large NBFCs is the climate for their ability to raise money directly from the public is very good at this point of time. Therefore, among some of the leading funds, one company raised Rs 5,000-crore NCDs in exactly two days from the market.

For the larger NBFCs who can diversify away from the banks, their funding resources, it is going to be a very good time for the next two to three years because they have a clean market for themselves.

Number two, as the banks start to get out of NBFCs or become a little bit careful, the smaller NBFCs will be in trouble in terms of raising. If you can raise equity, like you mentioned, your NBFC is safe and fine. But if you cannot raise equity, we should see lots of consolidation, lots of stress plays happening in the NBFC space. But the top five NBFCs of this country are very good and one can put money in the NBFCs because these guys are getting better yields. They can give LAP loans, commercial vehicle loans. They can give personal loans and control quite well at this point in time. Banks cannot do that. They are going to rely on industrial loans where the yields are going to be low. So, if you look at 4% yields, you have to be in NBFCs. For banks, gradually, the yield will shrink to 2-2.5% at this point of time and therefore, relatively speaking, large NBFCs would do much better for equity returns.

Get into consumer stocks; 2 stocks to buy as metals in a very sweet spot: Sanjiv Bhasin,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:39:00 AM IST","Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says “it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. We think the real income is going to be generated now from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where we are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.”

Bhasin also says “metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.”

Some of the consumer appliances companies, air-conditioner companies have had a very rough patch in the last few months. Voltas, Blue Star have come back. I would like to just bring to your notice a commentary coming in from one of the leading players last evening, which is Godrej Appliances. Yesterday, they said they are expecting 20% growth in the appliances business, including air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc, going into summer. If Godrej has visibility of 20% in appliances, it will surely rub off on the entire sector. Anything which you like there and what is your take on this commentary?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been stating that this is the time to be in consumer goods, whether white goods, staples, or even discretionary. Discretionary has outperformed as you are aware of two-wheeler and four-wheeler, but staples have hardly performed. So, we have been upbeat on Bata, Patanjali. We also own both Havells and Voltas and we think that the real income which is going to be generated now is from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where you are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.

Everyone has moved on to the AC market. And with the advent of lower inflation, lower rates, I think rural India is going to be the one where money is going to be made. So, it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. If you are looking forward to the next six months, anticipation of that sale starts from now. The Godrej commentary is a very big positive from one of the big players in this industry.

Any thoughts on these two, Indostar and IB Housing?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We put our money in IB Housing at Rs 115, 120 when there was no promoter over there with more than 1% holding. Only institutions owned it and it was available almost for free and pessimism was at its highest as the old owners, Banga and the rest of them, had all exited. That was a time you should have been in this stock because the valuation comfort was at 0.4, 0.3 times price to book. Now, all those have made a comeback because NBFC has actually upped the ante and like you pointed out, the industry average is at 1.5, 1.7.

The risk to reward was very favourable and now there is a transition with a new name and new promoters. We did invest, but we have booked out of that. We are now invested in Indiabulls Real Estate, where Embassy’s takeover and the merger is just on the anvil. NCLT will give it by the middle of March and that could be a game changer.

You can imagine what Rs 6,000 crore market cap means for one of the largest marquee builder of property in both Maharashtra and Delhi and I think that Indiabulls Real Estate can be a big game changer here. It also trades at a market cap closer to Rs 5,000, 6,000 crore against even defaulters like Unitech and Parsvnath which have Rs 4,000-5,000 crore market cap. So, risk-reward is very favourable there. Indiabulls Housing Finance is going to be a game changer because of the new structure and over a period of time, it will deliver very good results. A disclosure, Indiabulls Real Estate is where we are very-very bullish.

What is happening to the overall airport economy? Today as well Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on DreamFolks and they are suggesting a target price which is almost 30% to 35% higher than the current market price. Do you think that the entire aviation, hospitality sector, DreamFolks, GMR Airports, have further room on the upside?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I used to stick my neck out because I travel so much pan-India that at 35, I used to say on TV khade honi ki jagha nahi hai airport pe, kaise GMR 35 rupaiya hai?( There’s no place to stand in the airport and GMR share price is Rs 35?). And lo and behold, look at the unlocking of the value. Aerocity is doing rocking business as far as the hotel business goes. They are selling more Black Label than ever. When luxury turns into necessity, then there is no stopping barrier for the expansion on the upside. Go to any airport, in the Bombay Airport Terminal 2, there is a one hour waiting list just to get through.

So, I think this is there to stay. You have to catch on to the right themes which you want to play. I will also take a word, you were mentioning on Vedanta, yesterday I was there at their presentation. The presentation was superb as far as both the non-ferrous and ferrous side.

People are not aware, but in India the largest nickel producer and the only nickel producer is Vedanta. From BALCO, there is aluminium, there is zinc from Hindustan Zinc. You name the product on the non-ferrous side, it is there. Aside from that, there is thermal power, there is gas, and there is energy. So, sum of the parts, the management has clearly indicated that they are not going to raise anything on the company as far as debt goes, they are only going to reduce that.

If there is going to be value unlocking as per the plan and if you gave even 50% of that, then the valuation of the stock is so cheap that at Rs 99,000 crore market cap, this can even double and still look cheap. All we need is execution and going ahead on the promise which they have made in the presentation yesterday. As a disclosure, Vedanta is also under our coverage. We think metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.

This morning, Mr Khara of SBI spoke to our colleagues that capacity utilisation across industries is now hitting the 75% mark or thereabout, that is exactly the level from which on green shoots of actual capex enquiries start coming in. He was very confident of 14% to 15% credit growth. SBI was the last mover in banks but has done pretty well. Would you latch on to SBI or some of the big PSU banks like BOB, Can Bank?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We had all of them, PNB, Can Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, part of it in our portfolio, part we booked. But we are more bullish on the private banks, the comfort of earnings, the comfort of CASA ratio and the credit expansion. The liability franchise is just a matter. So, HDFC, Axis, ICICI are our top holdings now and we continue to do SIPs on those. I will go by Mr Khara's word, but SBI has already made a first mover to 750, whereas HDFC and ICICI, Axis are now rearing to go.

I would say private banks will lead the Bank Nifty and I would be more overweight on the private banks. Also, I wish you well in your journey on the voyage on the ship. As a disclosure, ABSL AMC has been under my coverage on your channel from 350-400. Yesterday, it hit a high of 529. Do not sell it till it hits 750, that is my advice to investors.

"Do not believe there is bubble or trouble in the market: Harish Krishnan, ABSL AMC","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:29:00 PM IST","Harish Krishnan, Co-CIO & Head -Equity, ABSL AMC, says in the last three years, from about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore of total profits, today we are close to about Rs 13-14 lakh crore of total profits.

So, it has not been something very ecstatic to say that there is a significant amount of overvaluation, that is point number one.

Are they a good team? Have they welcomed you well?
Harish Krishnan: Yes, they have, but I am taking this opportunity to thank myself.

Okay. It is a good team, good team. Ten years.
Harish Krishnan: So bubble or trouble, I do not think that we are in either camp that we should be very worried about, nor should we be in the camp that we should be greedy. Now, you can think that it is a hedged view that does not go to either extreme. But let me try and paraphrase, when we are asked, market kya lagta hai (how is the market?) because this is what comes to us whether we attend a wedding or a funeral in the side, a fund manager is always asked that.

Even at birthdays, actually
Harish Krishnan: There are basically three things in the market – earnings, liquidity and sentiment and the interplay of that is pretty much what determines the medium-term structure of markets. Now, if I take the first pillar, that of earnings, in the last three years, we have seen earnings double on the base.

So, just to give you some context of numbers, from about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore of total profits, today we are close to about Rs 13-14 lakh crore of total profits. If you really look at the journey of what the market caps have tracked, it has been pretty much in line. So, it has not been something very ecstatic to say that there is a significant amount of overvaluation, that is point number one.

The second point is that our share of GDP in the world is likely to keep going up. Today, we are at close to about 3.5% to 3.6% of world GDP and we definitely think that we should be punching way above that weight in years to come, maybe close to about 6-7% or maybe even 8% of GDP over the course of the next decade or so. If I look at the market cap of India, as a percentage of the world market cap, again we are close to about 3-3.5%. So, where really is a bubble to say that things have gone totally out of whack.

Yes, what we have today is a sentiment which possibly is at its extreme wherein everyone feels that nothing can go wrong in India. Everything that you think both structurally as well as cyclically is going right for India. When I say structurally, we all know all of those things, demographics, the fact that our digital stack is really firing, the fact that our productivity is improving. But even on a cyclical side, the fact that China is on the back foot in so many levels has also meant that cyclical tailwinds have come to India and which is kind of propped up and therefore the fear. Fund managers are always cynical.

The fear is that having got it too good, there can be some kind of a pullback in sentiment. Now, that is something which is very hard to measure and to evaluate and the only solution is to take a slightly longer-term view rather than getting worried about the next 3-6-12 months something can happen in China or China-Taiwan conflict. Beyond a point, there is nothing we can control about it. It is going to do what it will do. Let us focus on the companies and their execution and the capabilities and the growth profile of India.

The last point is that of liquidity. We are just getting started on liquidity. It might surprise you and while we have grown so stupendously as AUM, it might surprise all of you that even today cash in the hands of people is almost equivalent to 75% of all the household wealth that is in markets, including mutual funds, including direct stocks. It is still 75% and that is earning nothing. Despite demonetisation one, two, etc, whatever you have, that is the amount of money which is still earning nothing and which is there in people's homes under whatever mattresses, etc.

We are just about getting started when we think about the greater contours of each of these three elements. The last thing as to why is that we are positive on, of course the global and the macro is that at the end of the day, the source of growth in the future comes from the activities that companies do today. What is the one activity that they have to do to ensure that their growth profile remains sustained is capex.

Now, over the course of the last decade, capex was in neutral gear at about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore. I am talking about the listed companies. I told you that profits and cash flows are at Rs 13-14 lakh crores. Capex has now moved to Rs 8 lakh crore. After 10 years of no capex, we have started to see the first signs of capex moving to Rs 8 lakh crore. The Rs 8 lakh crore potentially can become Rs 10-12-14 lakh crore in the cycle and that will sow the seeds for the next growth cycle. As long as we are clear that the corporate balance sheet is in good shape, there is a growth profile, yes, there is some exuberance and sentiment in the near term, we have to be mindful and the only solution is asset allocation to have a longer patience rather than expecting fireworks every six months.

You have got the opening batsmen, you have got the middle order and then you have got the tail ender. Each have a particular purpose.

"Last day today to buy Bajaj Auto shares for Rs 4,000 crore buyback. Worth a trade?","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 09:48:00 AM IST","For those looking for an arbitrage trade opportunity, today is the last day to buy Bajaj Auto shares for participating in the Rs 4,000 crore buyback offer. Shares of the leading player in the Indian 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler vehicle industry has more than doubled in the last one year and is trading near its all-time high price of Rs 8,650.

Bajaj Auto is set to buy back 40 lakh shares, which is 1.41% of total outstanding shares, at an attractive price of Rs 10,000 per share, through the tender route at a total outlay not exceeding Rs 4,000 crore. The buyback price is 18% higher than Tuesday’s closing price of Rs 8,462 on BSE.

As the record date to participate in the buyback is February 29, the last day to buy shares to be eligible to apply for the special situations opportunity is today.

“We recommend retail shareholders to offer all the shares for the buyback since there is a decent arbitrage opportunity. There is a high probability of acceptance ratio coming on the higher side given that there are only 1.87 lakh shareholders holding nominal share capital up to Rs 2 lakh,” said Amar Nandu, Research Analyst – Samco Securities.

Calculations done by Nuvama shows that the acceptance ratio in the retail category could be between 4% to 10%. Those with investments of up to Rs 2 lakh are treated as retail investors.

“The fundamentals of the company are strong. It has been able to maintain a steady ROCE of around 25% over the past three years. There’s also a stable growth in the revenue. Currently, the share is trading at 32.4 PE multiple and 8.2 PB multiple at the price of Rs. 8,462 (Tuesday’s closing price), whereas the price offered in buyback is Rs 10,000, portraying an attractive valuation,” Nandu said.

The promoter holding is expected to exceed 56% post buyback.




In FY25, Axis Capital expects two-wheeler industry volumes to grow in high single-digits, driven by better rural demand, a turnaround in the economy segment, and continuing growth in executive/premium segments.

""Bajaj Auto's revenue growth in FY25/26 is likely to be supported by strong volume performance and better realizations. EBITDA margins are expected to expand slightly on a better scale,"" it said.

The company's strategy is to drive profitable growth in the 125cc+ segment through product differentiation and sharp positioning. With 6 new launches in the next 6 months, it aims to surpass the current 30% market share in the mid-segment.

Bajaj intends to ensure steady export recovery with QoQ improvement in sales in every market. Its African exports grew by double-digits, led by Nigeria. Moreover, Asia, MENA, and LATAM registered an encouraging single-digit improvement on a QoQ basis.

The two-wheeler major had reported a 37% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its standalone net profit at Rs 2,042 crore for the third quarter ended December 2023, beating ET Now poll estimate of Rs 1,961 crore. The company's profit was Rs 1,491 crore a year ago.

Revenue from operations in the said quarter increased by 30% YoY to Rs 12,114 crore, which was also higher than the poll estimate of Rs 11,875 crore. Revenues were at Rs 9,315 crore in the last year quarter.

The robust revenue growth was led by acceleration in the domestic business on the back of sharp execution and impactful activation during the festive season.

The export sales limited the growth to an extent, but the company said they are recovering amid continued challenges in the overseas markets.",The economic times
"Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan lose contracts as BCCI announces annual retainership for 2023-24 season","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 19:15 IST","NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan on Wednesday lost contracts, after both the batter decided to miss Ranji Trophy matches, as BCCI announced annual retainership for 2023-24 season.
Kishan has been on an extended break ""due to personal reasons"" since coming back from the India tour of South Africa in December-January. He has been practicing with his Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya at Baroda, but has not turned out for Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy despite being told to play the tournament by the Indian Board.
Iyer was absent from Mumbai's final Ranji Trophy league match against Assam at BKC and also missed the Ranji quarter-final against Baroda.
BCCI secretary Jay Shah had warned centrally contracted and India A cricketers last week that non-participation in the ongoing Ranji Trophy will not be tolerated and chief selector Ajit Agarkar would be given a ""free hand in this regard"".
And the board once again reiterated the same, recommending that all athletes give precedence to participating in domestic cricket during periods when they are not representing the national team.

For Disney, the merger follows its long-drawn struggle to arrest a user exodus from its bleeding India streaming business and financial strain caused by billions of dollars in Indian cricket rights payments. The merger valued the India business of the Burbank-based entertainment giant at just around a quarter of the $15 billion it was valued at when Disney acquired it as part of its Fox deal in 2019, sources have said.


The partnership was solidified through the signing of binding definitive agreements, wherein the media division of Viacom18 will be seamlessly integrated into Star India Private Limited (“SIPL”) through a court-approved scheme of arrangement.
Together, the Reliance-Disney merged entity will have 120 TV channels and two streaming platforms, helping Ambani emerge as a bigger, formidable force against rivals such as Japan's Sony , India's Zee Entertainment and Netflix in the $28 billion media and entertainment sector.
""The JV will be one of the leading TV and digital streaming platforms for entertainment and sports content in India, bringing together iconic media assets across entertainment,"" the companies said in a joint statement.",Times Of India
Pro-Pak slogans in Karnataka House: BJP says Congress 'anti-national',"Feb 28, 2024, 18:18 IST","NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on Wednesday criticized the Congress party for purportedly chanting 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans outside the Karnataka assembly. Bhatia accused the opposition party of harboring an anti-national ""DNA,"" labeling the incident as a derogatory act towards India's democratic values.
While addressing a press conference Bhatia said ""After the results of the Rajya Sabha elections came out, Congress workers outside the Karnataka assembly raised 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans while celebrating Congress MP-elect Syed Naseer Hussain's win.
This is a very worrying incident, this is an insult to India's democracy.""
""Today, every citizen is asking, whenever India's democracy marks a win, why is that the Congress always remembers Pakistan? There is also nothing wrong in saying that there is Pakistan's DNA in Congress,"" the BJP leader said.
He additionally demanded an apology from Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge for the occurrence.

According to the complaint lodged by the Karnataka BJP, it was claimed that following the announcement of Hussain's election to the Rajya Sabha by the returning officer around 7 pm on Tuesday, his supporters assembled at the Vidhana Soudha premises allegedly at Hussain's behest. It was alleged that they suddenly erupted into loud chants of 'Pakistan Zindabad' while cheering for Hussain.
""Congress' DNA has become anti-national. Earlier, slogans like Bharat will break into pieces, Insha Allah, Insha Allah, were raised at a public event attended by Rahul Gandhi. Don't you think Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge should apologise?"" he said.

Initially Congress refuted these allegations, asserting that its workers were merely chanting slogans in support of Hussain, not as claimed by the BJP. In contrast, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stated that voice samples had been dispatched to the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory), emphasizing that those responsible would face consequences.
""We have sent the voice report to the FSL, if it is true that somebody has raised the slogan 'Pakistan Zindabad', that person will be punished seriously,"" Siddaramaiah said.
Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said, ""We are very serious about it. If it is an anti-national slogan, we will not tolerate it. We will take strict actions, once it is confirmed by the FSL team. FIR has already registered yesterday. We have to identify the person from the FSL report and if it is true, we will take action against him.""
As per the complaint filed by the Karnataka BJP, it was alleged that after the returning officer declared that Hussain was elected to the Rajya Sabha, at around 7 pm on Tuesday, his supporters, who had gathered at the premises of the Vidhana Soudha ""at the instance of Hussain, suddenly shouted 'Pakistan Zindabad' slogans in a loud manner while cheering for Hussain.""

"Bitcoin hits $60,000 as 'FOMO' rally gathers pace","Feb 28, 2024, 19:57 IST","Bitcoin shattered expectations by hitting the $60,000 mark on Wednesday, a feat not seen in over two years. This surge is part of a larger trend, with a 42% price increase in February alone, marking its most significant monthly gain since December 2020. Currently, the cryptocurrency stands at $60,131, nearing its all-time high just below $70,000.
Week-on-week gains
The digital currency is also on track for its most substantial week-on-week increase in a year, boasting an 18.5% rise since February 21. This momentum underscores the growing interest and capital inflow into the cryptocurrency market, particularly into new US spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs).

Traders are flocking to bitcoin in anticipation of April's halving event, a mechanism designed to reduce the rate at which new coins are created, thereby slowing down the overall supply. Additionally, expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year have heightened the appeal of riskier, higher-yielding assets like bitcoin. ""Bitcoin is being driven by the support of consistent inflows into the new spot ETFs and outlook for April's halving event and June's Fed interest rate cuts,"" notes Ben Laidler, a strategist at eToro.

The ETF effect
The introduction of bitcoin ETFs has significantly impacted the market, with major funds like those run by Grayscale, Fidelity, and BlackRock witnessing surges in trading volumes. In fact, this week, shares in the three most popular bitcoin ETFs have seen a dramatic increase, signaling a heightened interest in cryptocurrency investment vehicles.
Capital inflows and supply dynamics
Inflows into the top ten spot bitcoin ETFs reached $420 million on Tuesday alone, reflecting a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency's future. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of Nexo, highlights the market's potential: ""If $60,000 doesn’t whet the appetite, consider that 70% of bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for a year."" This scarcity, coupled with increased institutional investment, suggests a bullish outlook for bitcoin's price.
Broader crypto market trends
Beyond bitcoin, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also experiencing significant growth, with a 3.2% increase to $3,353 and a 47% rise in February. This uptick has sparked hopes among investors for the approval of ETFs based on spot ether, indicating a broader market trend towards mainstream acceptance of various cryptocurrencies.
Future outlook
While the current market environment appears steady, there is an undercurrent of FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors.
""There certainly isn't a manic feeling to who's buying and why - ether gaining against the field also speaks to a more measured environment - but there's at least a little FOMO (fear of missing out) going on right now,"" Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, told Reuters.
The steady rise of ether, alongside bitcoin's explosive growth, suggests a more mature, albeit still speculative, market landscape. As US regulators consider more applications for cryptocurrency-based ETFs, the market awaits with bated breath for the next phase of crypto investment evolution.

HawkEye founder dismisses England's outburst on Joe Root's LBW dismissal,"Feb 28, 2024, 19:06 IST","NEW DELHI: Joe Root's LBW dismissal in the second innings of the fourth Test became a huge talking point after former England players raised questions on the accuracy of the Decision Review System (DRS).
Root was adjudged LBW off a Ravichandran Ashwin delivery during England's second innings.

The incident took place in the 17th over of the innings when an Ashwin delivery hit Root straight on the pads. As the on-field umpire ruled it not out, the Indian team went upstairs and the decision was reversed, resulting in Root's departure.

Paul Hawkins, the founder of the HawkEye technology employed for ball-tracking in the DRS in cricket, has joined in the raging debate and shrugged off all the suggestions around DRS.
He said that the correct decision was made by third umpire Joel Wilson in overturning on-field umpire Kumar Dharmasena's call.
""So firstly, you measure the width of the stumps on each day of the Test. That then becomes the lines between what's pitched in line and what's not. It was a very close-on (Joe Root call),"" Hawkinds told Simon Hughes in the 'The Analyst' podcast.


Hawkins clarified the distinction in the application of HawkEye technology in tennis and cricket. He mentioned that the response to Root's LBW call provides an opportunity for them to enhance and refine the visual aspects of the ball-tracking system.
""In tennis, you will occasionally get zero mm in or zero mm out (in terms of ball pitching outside the line). But in tennis, it's decided that it's not out until it's not zero mm, but it's 1mm out. So in tennis, we shift the bounce mark just for the presentation perspective, so a zero mm in becomes a 1mm in to enable the viewers to see the mark.
""But that's just a presentation thing, nothing different with the tracking or the answer. It just makes it clearer to the viewer.

""It would have been clearer on TV if the track hadn't come off the ball, so you can see more clearly over the line, which happens automatically if the ball has pitched outside the leg stump.
""It must be 1mm more in than out (Joe Root case) because otherwise, we wouldn't have said it's pitched in line. But it is a very close one.
As per the laws, we gave the right answer. But we failed in the ability to not be the story and perhaps there's a learning opportunity to improve our presentation and stuff to make those really close ones slightly clearer,"" he added.",Times Of India

"What's in a leap year? Eternal youth, wedding bells and tech bugs","Feb 28, 2024, 18:04 IST","NEW DELHI: Every four years, the calendar grants us an extra day, and the unique phenomenon of February 29 has become a source of fascination, rituals, and even superstitions. Let's dive into the world of leap years:
The science behind leap years: Keeping in sync with the seasons
Leap years have been part of our calendar since the 16th century, courtesy of the Gregorian calendar. Introduced to address the fractional discrepancy in the solar year, this calendar quirk adds an extra day to keep us in sync with the seasons. The Earth takes around 365.2422 days to orbit the sun each year, and the additional six hours annually accumulate over time. Leap days ensure our alignment with the seasons, preventing potential chaos for farmers, crops, and school holidays.

With approximately one in 1,500 chances of being born on a leap day, there are an estimated five million leaplings globally. Most leap years occur every four years, skipping years divisible by 100 unless they are divisible by 400. Notable leap year birthdays include French screen star Michele Morgan, who cheekily attributed her longevity to being a leapling, celebrating her birthday only once every four years until the age of 96. Other famous leaplings include Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez, US rap star Ja Rule, and the infamous Aileen Wuornos, portrayed by Charlize Theron in ""Monster.""

Traditions and superstitions: Leap day rituals around the world
In Ireland, February 29 is known as Bachelor's Day or Ladies Privilege, allowing women to propose to men. Hollywood embraced this tradition in the movie ""Leap Day"" in 2010.
Deals on flights and hotels to mark the occasion
Businesses often seize the opportunity of this rare day for special promotions. Legal Sea Foods in the northeastern US offers lobster discounts, while Papa John's launched its Perfect Pan Pizza on leap day in 2008. Hotels and airlines also join the celebration with special deals and promotions.
Leap year glitches: Online mayhem and system errors
Leap years, however, have not been without their share of online mayhem. In the year 2000, predictions of a total information shutdown on January 1 did not materialize. Yet, on February 29, a series of system errors occurred worldwide, including Japan's meteorological service issuing faulty weather reports and Montreal's tax service experiencing a temporary shutdown.
As February 29 approaches, the world prepares to indulge in the peculiar charm of leap year traditions, from birthday celebrations to proposals and unique promotions. It's a day that reminds us to appreciate the quirks that make our calendar—and our lives—so interesting.",Times Of India

As a designer and model, what initially drew you to the world of fashion and design? Can you share some insights into your creative process?
I have been surrounded by art and fabrics my whole life. My grandmother had a textile business that specialized in embroidery and fabrics, while my mom had a knitwear label and is also a painter. I grew up with old fashion magazines and FashionTV and was always in love with clothing. My inspiration comes from women and their forms, as well as from travel and the outdoors.

It’s hard to say as I have had lots of interesting journeys. Fashion and film have taken me to some of the most incredible destinations. Shooting a film under the Eiffel Tower or a magazine cover in Zanzibar are just some of the amazing experiences I have had.

Who, according to you, is the most well-dressed personality in Bollywood?
It's a hard one, as no one is perfect, and taking risks in fashion sometimes means making mistakes. I think
Malaika Arora would be my spirit animal, as her love for fashion shows in everything she does. For men, Arjun Rampal is timeless and classic.
If you get a chance to dress a Bollywood actress or actor, who would you pick and why?
I am blessed to have worked with my wishlist, and all of them come with their own flair, which I love. I don’t think we have dressed Alia Bhatt in ages, and I love her look.
Being a mother to your sons must be incredibly rewarding. How has motherhood changed your perspective on life and work?
Motherhood makes you more focused, compassionate, and strict with your time. Overall, it’s been wonderful for my work life. I only do things I value and only meet people I admire and care about because it’s hard to separate from your children for anything that doesn’t spark you.
Public Review of 'Crakk' | Vidyut Jammwal, Arjun Rampal, Nora Fatehi, Amy Jackson

Tell us something about your love story with Arjun. How did you guys meet, and when did your love blossom?
We don’t really have a very dramatic love story. We had known each other for a long time as mere acquaintances, and then when the time was right, we just knew.
Can you describe your relationship with Mahikaa and Myra and how you've grown together as a family unit?
They are wonderful humans, and they have a great mom and dad who have brought them up very well. I am very blessed to have them in my life, and I think Arik and his brother have the best sisters.
Do you have any acting aspirations?
No, I don’t. I think acting is a serious business, and I have tried my hand at it, but my passion is fashion. I think I will leave the acting to the very hardworking and talented individuals who make it their lives. I just want to see my brand grow to new heights.

As a model, have you ever been conscious of your body? If yes, how did you overcome it?
Yes, very! I was always told many things were wrong with me, and I tried to change them. I wasn’t thin enough, not tall enough. I really wanted to work on those things, but age has made me accept and welcome my body and my face. I would love all the younger models out there to remain true to themselves because everyone is beginning to look alike.
Do you feel Bollywood is somewhat responsible for setting the fake beauty standards that young girls fall prey to?
No, I don’t blame Bollywood at all. It’s many years of cultural beauty and fashion standards that have perpetuated it. I think Instagram filters and Botox are more responsible. People need to showcase their flaws, or young women are going to believe we all don’t have any, and that’s really scary. I read an article recently about the depression rate in teen girls, and it’s since the inception of social media. Films were always there, but this is a whole new world.
Was it difficult to break the stereotype that models cannot be a businesswoman?
I think the world is changing so fast. I think it’s about how you feel and what you think you can achieve. I’ve never succumbed to stereotypes.",Times Of India

In a recent interview, Diljit shared about the intense research that Imtiaz has done for the film and the experience working with him.
While talking to Film Companion, Diljit said that Imtiaz used to send at least one mail every day to explain bits and pieces about Chamkila’s personality, including his walking style and all.
The director was truly serious and focused. The actor thought that it would be easy to understand the life of Chamkila because he is from the same place as him, Punjab, and have heard a lot of songs of Amar. But he believes that Imtiaz knows him more. Diljit always wanted to work with a big director like him and he says, “I have never had a schooling like this.”

The incident came to light after the employer’s driver noticed the front door ajar and the house ransacked in the early hours of Feb 23.
In his police complaint, Prasada Rao Kamineni, 46, identified the prime suspects as Kamal and Deeksha, both aged between 23 and 25 years. A senior police officer said the accused couple is suspected to be heading towards Nepal. Kamineni owns a multi-storey building on III Cross in Sunshine Layout. The accused couple stayed in the basement — Kamal was the building’s security guard, while Deeksha was working in Kamineni’s house for one-and-a-half years. Kamineni had rented out the first, second and third floors. His family lived in a duplex flat on the fourth and fifth floors.
On Feb 21, Kamineni and family locked the house around 8am and left for Ayodhya on a pilgrimage. Kamineni asked his car driver Ravi Kumar to keep watch and gave him a set of keys for the main metal door.
Two days later, Kamineni received a call from Kumar, saying the front door was ajar. Kamineni asked him to check inside the house and Kumar said the doors of a few rooms were opened and clothes and other valuables were lying scattered on the floor. Kumar said the Nepali couple was missing since morning.

"Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan lose contracts as BCCI announces annual retainership for 2023-24 season","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 19:15 IST","NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan on Wednesday lost contracts, after both the batter decided to miss Ranji Trophy matches, as BCCI announced annual retainership for 2023-24 season.
Kishan has been on an extended break ""due to personal reasons"" since coming back from the India tour of South Africa in December-January. He has been practicing with his Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya at Baroda, but has not turned out for Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy despite being told to play the tournament by the Indian Board.
Iyer was absent from Mumbai's final Ranji Trophy league match against Assam at BKC and also missed the Ranji quarter-final against Baroda.
BCCI secretary Jay Shah had warned centrally contracted and India A cricketers last week that non-participation in the ongoing Ranji Trophy will not be tolerated and chief selector Ajit Agarkar would be given a ""free hand in this regard"".
And the board once again reiterated the same, recommending that all athletes give precedence to participating in domestic cricket during periods when they are not representing the national team.
Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja have been placed in the highest category (Grade A+) of BCCI central contracts.
KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, and Mohammed Siraj have been promoted to the Grade A category in the central contracts list, signifying their significant contributions and performances.
On the other hand, Rishabh Pant, who missed a substantial part of the season due to recovery from a road accident, has been placed in Grade B.

The contracts for Team India (Senior Men) will run from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.
""Athletes who meet the criteria of playing a minimum of 3 Tests or 8 ODIs or 10 T20Is within the specified period will automatically be included in Grade C on a pro-rata basis,"" BCCI said in a media statement.
""For instance, Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan, having played 2 Test matches so far, will be inducted into Grade C if they participate in the Dharamsala Test Match, i.e., the 5th Test of the ongoing series against England,"" the statement added.
The selection committee also recommended fast bowling contracts for the following athletes – Akash Deep, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Umran Malik, Yash Dayal and Vidwath Kaverappa.
Rinku Singh and Tilak Varma are among the notable new faces included in the central contracts list for cricket. Both players have been added to the Grade C category, which comprises 15 players.
Noteworthy in this category are the strong comebacks of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Shivam Dube to the Indian T20I team. Jitesh Sharma, who replaced Ishan Kishan in the Indian T20I team, is also part of the Grade C list.
Incidentally, the BCCI this time has not mentioned the remuneration of the players across the four categories. Cricketers are normally paid Rs 7 crore per annum in A plus bracket, Rs 5 crore in A, Rs 3 crore in B and Rs one crore in C category, over and above their match fees.
LIST OF ANNUAL CONTRACTS:

"Airtel is 'changing' its SIM cards, here's the 'good' reason","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 18:21 IST","Airtel has announced its move to switch partnership from virgin plastic to recycled PVC SIM cards. For this move, the telecom major has partnered with Idemia Secure Transactions. This move is in line with the company’s commitment to encouraging the adoption of circular business practices. Idemia Secure Transactions, a division of the Idemia Group, is a provider of payment and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, mobile network operators and automotive manufacturers.
How Airtel’s recycled PVC SIM cards are good for environment
Airtel became the first telecommunications service provider to switch to recycled plastic SIM cards.
With this migration, the generation of over 165 tonnes of virgin plastic will be limited which will further reduce the generation of over 690 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in one year.
This migration is in line with Airtel’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gases and promoting circularity with supplier partners and other stakeholders with the aim of encouraging them to reduce waste, recycle and reuse products.

Airtel has committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations by 50.2% by FY 2030-31 with FY 2020-21 as the base year. The company has also committed to reducing its absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 42% over the same time frame.
In line with this commitment, some of the key initiatives at Airtel include promoting energy efficiency, utilising open-access green energy and adopting renewable energy across operations, as well as building a climate resilient network, resource efficiency and waste management.

Carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2 equivalent is a metric used to compare the emissions from various GHGs on the basis of their global-warming potential, converted to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.
What the company said about this move
Pankaj Miglani, Director of Supply Chain at Bharti Airtel, said: “We are delighted to announce yet another first as we continue to lead the Indian telecom industry. As a brand we endeavour to align our efforts to adopt various sustainable measures and contribute significantly towards India’s ambition to achieve net zero. Our collaboration with Idemia underscores our shared commitment to contributing to a sustainable future.”",Times Of India
"Reliance, Disney announce merger; Nita Ambani to be chairperson","Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 19:25 IST","NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), Viacom 18 Media Private Limited, and the Walt Disney Company have officially announced a strategic joint venture, creating an $8.5 billion entertainment juggernaut far ahead of rivals in the world's most populous nation.

For Disney, the merger follows its long-drawn struggle to arrest a user exodus from its bleeding India streaming business and financial strain caused by billions of dollars in Indian cricket rights payments. The merger valued the India business of the Burbank-based entertainment giant at just around a quarter of the $15 billion it was valued at when Disney acquired it as part of its Fox deal in 2019, sources have said.


The partnership was solidified through the signing of binding definitive agreements, wherein the media division of Viacom18 will be seamlessly integrated into Star India Private Limited (“SIPL”) through a court-approved scheme of arrangement.
Together, the Reliance-Disney merged entity will have 120 TV channels and two streaming platforms, helping Ambani emerge as a bigger, formidable force against rivals such as Japan's Sony , India's Zee Entertainment and Netflix in the $28 billion media and entertainment sector.

Use Russian asset profits to arm Ukraine: EU chief,"Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 18:08 IST","STRASBOURG: European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen called on Wednesday for profits from Russian assets frozen in the West to be used to fund military equipment for Ukraine.
Calls have been mounting to find ways to support Kyiv's war effort by tapping the bank accounts, investments and other assets frozen after Russia invaded its neighbour in 2022.

Simply confiscating the funds is not seen as an option but the EU is working on ways to use the profits they generate, which alone could represent billions of euros a year.
""It is time to start a conversation about using the windfall profits of frozen Russian assets to jointly purchase military equipment for Ukraine,"" von der Leyen said in a speech to the European Parliament.

Kyiv says it desperately needs more military and financial assistance, with a fresh $60 billion US package stalled in Congress.
""With or without the support of our partners, we cannot let Russia win,"" von der Leyen told lawmakers.
""And the cost of insecurity -- the cost of a Russian victory -- is far greater than any saving we could make now.""
The EU has frozen more than 200 billion euros ($220 billion) of Russian central bank assets, with about 90 percent held by an international deposit organisation in Belgium.

""Ultimately this is about Europe taking responsibility for its own security,"" said von der Leyen, whose speech addressed the broader question of European sovereignty and defence as Russia's war on Ukraine enters its third year.
""The threat of war may not be imminent, but it is not impossible,"" she said. ""The risks of war should not be overblown, but they should be prepared for.""

Indranil Banerjie | Western hysteria mounts as Russia makes Ukraine gains,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"The Russian capture of Avdiivka sent shock waves across Western capitals and blew a hole in the propaganda about Russia slowly losing the war in Ukraine. This battlefield victory was the most significant since Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut in May 2023. The latest Ukrainian pullback coming after last year’s failed summer counter-offensive and continued Russian pressure along the 1,000-km-wide frontline suggested that things were not moving to Kyiv’s advantage. A triumphant Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka and pledged to push further into Ukraine.
The Western response to these setbacks, which came precisely a week before the second anniversary (February 24) of the Russian invasion, has been close to hysterical. Mr Putin has been termed a tyrant, a war criminal and a “crazy SOB” by top Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. Washington slapped 600 new sanctions on Russia, which came on top of 4,000 earlier sanctions imposed by the US since the start of the war. Similarly, the European Union introduced new sanctions (its 13th since the war began in February 2022) on several foreign companies and individuals for exporting products that could have military use for Russia.
The US Senate has also passed a military aid package (temporarily stuck in the House of Representatives) earmarking $61 billion for Ukraine. Europe has signed a 50-billion-euro cheque for Ukraine. There has also been some debate about seizing Russia’s $300 billion-plus foreign assets lodged in Western banks, a move that would seriously undermine the
global financial system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has only fanned Western anxieties by claiming that his country is just the first step in Mr Putin’s determination to subjugate all of Europe, a charge that the Russian President has vehemently denied.
Four top Western leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Italy, Canada and Belgium and the European Commission president arrived in Kyiv on the war’s second anniversary to pledge solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy’s continued war efforts. “We will stand with Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau declared, as he pledged $2.25 billion in financial and military support. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, while signing a 10-year defence pact with Ukraine, said: “The message I want to send today to… all the Ukrainian people is that they are not alone.”
With the Ukrainian and Western leadership digging in their heels and refusing Mr Putin’s offer to freeze the frontlines and negotiate an end to the war, the global rift and associated risks are only increasing.
For the moment, President Zelenskyy faces enormous challenges. He has had to sack his popular top military commander and major corruption allegations in arms dealings have surfaced in recent times, both of which have contributed to a lowering of military morale. Not surprisingly, a staggering six million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the war.
The Russian forces, despite a torrent of Western propaganda, are not on the backfoot. They continue to control about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the key regional city of Donetsk, whose security was bolstered by the capture of Avdiivka 15 km to the north. Moscow has successfully ramped up military production and is able to fire more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers are also exhausted, compelling Mr Zelenskyy to push for a bill to conscript an additional half a million Ukrainians into the Army, a move some say would cripple the country’s floundering economy.
The West’s strategy of crippling the Russian economy has not worked. The West had included a series of measures, including a cap on Russian oil prices, to derail its hydrocarbon economy. Nothing like that has happened; on the contrary, oil exports are close to prewar levels and, according to the IMF, Russia’s GDP expanded 3.6 per cent in 2023.
Ironically, it is Europe that seems to have suffered the worst economic battering, dependent as it was on cheap Russian energy exports. Having unilaterally turned off its taps to Russian energy, Europe faces an unprecedented surge in energy prices that have made large sections of its industry uncompetitive and sent farm costs skyrocketing. Europe today is paralysed by farm protests while economic growth has plummeted.
Geopolitically too, Moscow has held out with many nations outside the Western bloc not in sympathy with Western aims. A New York Times report pointed out that “Mr Putin is not nearly as isolated as US officials had hoped. Russia’s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing.”
Faced with this reality, pressures are mounting in Europe to clamp down further on countries that are seen to be aiding Moscow’s war efforts, and this includes India, which along with China has been buying billions of dollars of Russian oil. India so far has very successfully been able to manoeuvre around the Western blockade of Russia, but it will find it increasingly difficult to stay that course.
The only acceptable outcome for the Western leadership is an unconditional Russian defeat, which finds echoes in Mr Zelenskyy’s declaration that he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukrainian soil. This intransigence towards Russia has another, more ominous, aspect that could also adversely impact India.
And that is the cleaving of the global economy into two antagonistic halves. The Western powers have effectively pulled down a new iron curtain across the world, with Russia and its allies on the dark side. The gradual Western decoupling from China is adding to the global rift. This tectonic shift in global geoeconomics will pose a huge challenge for India, which has no desire to take sides or be sucked into the maelstrom of distant crises. But the fall of Avdiivka could well presage testing times ahead.",The Deccan Chronicle
DC Edit | Sandeshkhali: Bengal govt has a lot to answer,28 Feb 2024 12:10 AM,"As per the court order, a wrong impression had been created that a stay order on the arrest of this person was granted. “There is nothing on record staying the arrest and, therefore, the said person shall be arrested by the police authorities”, the court stated on Monday. Left with no alternative, the government assured a division bench headed by the Chief Justice that the police will arrest the accused in a week’s time.
A division bench of the high court had originally stayed an investigation by a joint team of state police and the Enforcement Directorate against Mr Sheikh, who is also the TMC’s convenor of Sandeshkhali Assembly constituency, into a mob attack on a team of ED officers who went to raid his residence in Sandeshkhali on January 5 in connection with an old land-grab case.
It is now clear that the government and the ruling party has been using this as an alibi to evade action in this new instance involving 42 FIRs filed by women over four years. Not only is this a brazen attempt to obfuscate a court order, it is also an open display of arrogance towards the rule of law and an unacceptable attempt to fool the aggrieved. That the TMC has realised its game is up is reflected in the statement of the party spokesperson who thanked the high court “for untying the tangle and allowing the police to take action”.
For quite some time, happenings in Sandeshkhali, located on the Sunderbans border, have horrified citizens. It may be remembered that the state police has made little or no effort to apprehend Mr Sheikh, a close aide of TMC MLA and former minister Jyotipriya Mallick who was earlier arrested in the ration scam case, for the attack on the ED team.
He is now facing the more serious allegation of sexually exploiting the women in the village along with his aides and engaging in grabbing their land as well. Protests have been simmering in the area since February 6. Agitated people even vandalised the properties of Uttam Sardar and Shibu Hazra, two trusted lieutenants of Mr Sheikh, over the next three days. The state government, instead of following procedures and investigating the serious allegations, tried to cover them up. It enforced prohibitory orders and suspended Internet services at 16 gram panchayats in Sandeshkhali-I and Sandeshkhali-II blocks. It also blocked teams of Opposition politicians who ventured to the area to apprise themselves of the situation.
The Trinamul Congress and the government it heads have been engaged in an attempt to brush the series of developments under the carpet and allow its leader to escape the arm of the law. It is time the state police and other agencies are told in no uncertain terms that their job is to protect the citizen. Doing the bidding of political masters does not behove a professional force.
As for the Trinamul Congress, it is inviting the wrath of the people who hold the power to teach it the right lesson.",The Deccan Chronicle

"India slowly taking export market share from China, study shows","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:20:00 PM IST","India is chipping away at China’s dominance in electronics exports in some key markets as manufacturers diversify supply chains away from the world’s factory to other parts of Asia, a new study shows.

The impact is most pronounced in the UK and US, where geopolitical tensions with China have increased in recent years.

India’s electronics exports to the US as a ratio of China’s increased to 7.65% in November last year from 2.51% in November 2021, according to London-based Fathom Financial Consulting. In the UK, the share rose to 10% from 4.79%.

India’s government is luring electronics manufacturers to the country with heavy incentives, such as tax cuts, rebates, easier land acquisition and capital support. The aim is to expand the domestic manufacturing industry in order to export more, and help businesses grow to global scale through partnerships.

India houses Samsung Electronics Co.’s biggest mobile phone factory, while Apple Inc. makes at least 7% of all its iPhones in India through its contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp.

The rise in electronic exports is “likely the result of Foxconn’s increasing investment in India,” Andrew Harris, an economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, wrote in a note last week.

Bloomberg

India’s progress in gaining market share has been more limited in Europe and Japan, “suggesting a move towards dual supply chains (China plus one) rather than a complete abandonment of China-based production, at least for now,” Harris said. The report shows that India’s electronics exports as a ratio of China’s was 3.38% in Germany and 3.52% globally.

Indian companies have been touting their role in multinationals’ ‘China plus one’ strategy, which sees manufacturers developing back-up capacity in other countries.
Bloomberg

India’s rising market share is a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has touted his ‘Make in India’ plan as a way of creating jobs, expanding exports and making the economy more self reliant by reducing the need for imports. He’s widely expected to win a third term in office in elections due within a few months.

"With new fund infusion, does Vodafone Idea stand a chance of revival?","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:20:00 PM IST","Vodafone Idea, the telecom JV between UK’s Vodafone Plc and India’s Aditya Birla Group with the government as the largest shareholder, might be about to turn a corner. Crumbling under debt, government charges, losses and eroding market share, the telco has struggled to raise funds for the past few years. In a business with deep-pocket rivals such as Reliance Jio, a beleaguered Vodafone Idea would stand little chance of surviving. However, the government wants it to keep running to prevent the Jio-Airtel duopoly to control the telecom market. The government became the largest stakeholder in Vi with a 33.1% stake in February last year, when the telecom department converted the company’s accrued interest on deferred adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues worth Rs 16,133 crore into equity.

But now there's a ray of hope for Vodafone Idea. The telco has announced a massive refinancing plan of up to Rs 45,000 crore which will be raised through a combination of equity, including promoter financing, and debt. A capital infusion is just what it needs but will it help the telco come out of a long crisis of survival?

The decline of Vodafone Idea
Since 2007, when Hutch was rebranded as Vodafone, the Indian telecom industry has been through dramatic changes. With massive subscriber growth, 3G around the corner, and new players in the fray, average revenue per user (ARPU) started to come down. Companies began to focus more on shareholder returns and competition turned ugly in the shape of cut-throat pricing wars. Later, the stormy entry of Jio created string tremors with huge price cuts. Over more than a decade, Vodafone and Idea in particular lost ground to the competition. Jio came as a big shock. While Airtel too faced trouble, it managed to fight it out.

Rather than a consolidation and the synergies making things better, the merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular in 2018 worsened the situation for the new entity. Ideally, synergies should've been one of the factors leading to the merger between Vodafone & Idea. However, in reality things were the other way around: It was the merged entity that later started looking for synergies. “If two large organisations are merging not because of synergies but out of desperation, the merged entity will face a lot of challenges,” Amit Mantri, co-founder of portfolio-management service 2Point2 Capital, had told ET at that time. Consequently, Vodafone Idea struggled with its post-merger blues -- lack of strategic direction; integration issues in networks and human resources; and challenges related to cultural fit. The core values and structure of Vodafone and Idea were different — Idea was a promoter-led company and Vodafone was a global professionally run organisation. The merged entity could never take off just as the competition grew, new technology demanded more capital and payouts to the government weighed on the telco.

Vodafone Idea’s gross debt at the end of the third quarter stood at a huge Rs 2.15 lakh crore, comprising deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1.38 lakh crore, AGR liability of Rs 69,020 crore due to the government, dues worth Rs 6,050 crore towards banks and financial institutions, and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1,660 crore. As the debt widened in the fiscal third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 318.9 crore. The company says its bank debt now stands at less than Rs 4,500 crore.

The company has been reporting quarterly losses as well as losing subscribers to Airtel and Reliance Jio month after month. Airtel and Reliance Jio's ARPU, a key performance metric for telecom companies, stood at Rs 208 and Rs 181.7 respectively in the December quarter, for Vodafone Idea the same was Rs 145.

Airtel and Jio added 3 million and 1.21 million active users respectively in December, while Vi lost 1.84 million active users, latest customer data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed. Trai's wireless broadband user data showed that Jio and Airtel added 14.37 million and 9.7 million 4G/5G users respectively in December, while Vi added 0.66 million 3G/4G users.

However, in the quarter, the company focused on paying off external dues and reduced vendor overdues over capital investments that dramatically lagged peers Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel spending on 4G and 5G expansion. ""Vi repaid Rs 1,900 crore of external dues (versus Rs 400-500 crore according to original schedule) and repaid Rs 1,300 crore of vendor overdues from the cash generation in Q3FY24 and income tax refunds,"" stock research firm Kotak Institutional Equities had said in a report.

How the funds infusion can help
Vodafone Idea has been struggling to raise funds for more than three years now. The large capital infusion of Rs 45,000 crore will be used to pay the government and large vendors like Indus Towers too.

Will it work?
Will this capital infusion put Vodafone Idea in reckoning with its bigger rivals Jio and Airtel? Paying out the government and vendors, expanding the 4G services and rolling out the 5G can surely help the telco plug leakages and add market share. But will it strengthen the company enough to enable it to compete with its rivals?

""Operationally, this fund-raise is surely a step in the right direction. This will enable VIL to improve its 4G services and catch up (to some extent) with peers on 5G rollout, to be able to arrest the subscribers' decline and make meaningful EBITDA to be able to service the debt obligations. Financially, however, the fund-raise size is too small, to have any meaningful impact,"" said Nuvama's Vibhor Singhal.

There could be challenges with debt servicing too.""We will also have to see how they are going to service that debt because there has been no bank default by Vodafone,"" Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, has told ET Now. ""They are already servicing a large debt which they have to pay to the Government of India and also the rest of it. So I would say it is a positive direction and an ambitious target. But we need more clarity on how they are going to fund that.""

Also, the telco’s annual payouts to the government would jump to an estimated Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 when the four-year payment moratorium ends. The government payouts will be toward deferred spectrum dues of past auctions as well as annual instalments for past AGR-related dues.

In the near term, Nomura said that a significant fund-raise will be a material positive and will enable the company to cover upcoming dues, commence its 5G rollout, and improve its operational performance by curtailing the decline in the subscriber base in the near term and start growing the subscriber base again in the coming years. ""We note that if VIL can tie up the entire fund raise, it will be a material positive; however, VIL will not be fully out of the woods, in our view. Repair, recovery, and rollout of 5G will take time to fructify and will be crucial to an improvement in its outlook,"" it said.

""The significant amount of cash required to service debt leaves limited upside opportunities for equity holders, even with the potential operating leverage benefits from any increase in ARPU. Given the current low EBITDA, servicing the debt without external funding will be challenging,"" Motilal Oswal has said.

Too big to fail
Vodafone Idea's nearly 22 crore subscriber base makes it too big to fail. Failure of Vodafone will be devastating for India's telecom sector as a whole because Jio and Airtel don’t have the capacity to absorb such a huge subscriber base. This will constrain their infrastructure and worsen service and quality standards. A duopoly in the sector could also lead to rising tariffs. That's why it is vital for Vodafone Idea to survive its multifaceted crisis.

Besides the Rs 45,000 capital injection, the telco would need strategic nimbleness, government encouragement and lots of luck. Improving its competitiveness and stepping into the 5G segment should enable it to return to a growth trajectory in terms of subscriber additions, Nomura has said.

How dark stores are powering quick commerce's rise,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 08:22:00 AM IST","The old building on Bengaluru’s busy Richmond Road had a quaint charm despite the relentless traffic. The occupancy level was low compared with the average trend in the area and next door was a legacy Raj bungalow that added to the serene tone. But all that changed when the basement got a new occupant.

At any given point of time a dozen or more youngsters were milling about, e-bikes zoomed in and out of the building, and suddenly the basement had more activity than all the other four floors combined. Just that no one quite knew what all the chaos was about.

It was a Q-com company, or quick commerce firm, that had set up its dark store. At the heart of the ‘quick’ behind this new form of commerce are these micro warehouses that have mushroomed all over urban commercial centres. Operated by players such as Zomato’s Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Bigbasket’s BB Now, they house a limited number of high-frequency use products.

A small, yet nimble, group of employees ensures that orders are packed, dispatched and delivered in a matter of minutes. And then those riders on e-bikes—many of them helmetless and not too mindful of traffic rules—swarm the place. It’s all to do with speed you see.

Modus Operandi

As per industry insiders, dark store employees can take as little as 15 seconds to pick and pack an item. ET visited a Blinkit dark store in Noida in the National Capital Region to see how this works. As soon as a customer places an order, the nearest dark store is notified.

The team lead who manages the store sends the list to a colleague. He packs the items and brings them to the counter.

Simultaneously, the team lead also sends this order to a QR code at the entrance. A delivery partner waiting in a queue outside scans the QR code. He gets to know what’s in the order as well as the delivery location. The delivery partner cross-checks the items packed and leaves for the destination.

The customer is notified and given an estimate of the delivery time. Once the package delivered, the delivery partner swipes the ‘delivered’ tab on the app to indicate the task has been completed.

Such stores are owned and managed by franchisee partners. The fleet of riders could be managed by either the franchisee partner or the quick commerce company. They are usually gig workers who are not there for the long haul. The design of the dark store itself helps shave off precious seconds from the packing time.

“The most frequently ordered items such as bread, eggs, milk and dairy products are stored right up front,” said Pravesh Singh, who manages a Zepto dark store in East Delhi. “We have five stores in a radius of 4-5 km in a Gurgaon locality. This means that the store gets closer to a customer. We have primary stores, secondary stores… which move de-pending on factors such as traffic movement during evening hours,” Blinkit’s Dhindsa said.

Quick commerce companies also study weather patterns and road conditions to determine what the fastest routes to a particular destination will be. Access control platforms such as Mygate and Nobroker work with delivery companies to allow for quicker permissions to delivery executives. “If there are multiple access points to a building, we study which particular gate will provide faster access to which block, and guide delivery partners accordingly,” a Gurgaon-based executive at one of the firms said on condition of anonymity.

Gig Challenges

Payments to delivery partners have been a sore spot for the quick commerce industry since inception. These gig workers, contracted by the companies directly for their franchisee-owned dark stores, have often complained of poor work conditions and low incomes.

In April last year, thousands of Blinkit delivery partners went on a strike after the company changed its payment structure. It moved from a fixed fee of Rs 25 per order plus Rs 7 during rush hour to a Rs 15 per order fixed fee and a distance-based component. The strike in Delhi-NCR went on for more than a week, hitting the firm hard in its biggest market.

Noida-based delivery partner Raja Sheikh said that there are additional incentives on days like New Year Eve when there are a higher number of orders. “Otherwise, the payout after a 15-hour workday is around Rs 500-600 before all costs. If you deliver 25 orders during peak hours, then there is additional incentive,” he said.

Dhindsa said service is expected to get better as Blinkit adds more dark stores. The company has more than 450 stores on its network across 25 cities. So don’t be surprised if a quiet corner suddenly turns chaotic—it’s just another dark store.",The economic times

Considerations are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made, the people said, adding that KKR could choose not to pursue a deal.

A representative for KKR declined to comment, while JB Pharma didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

KKR bought a controlling stake in JB Pharma in 2020 from the founding Mody family, along with making an open offer for an additional 26% stake.

Janus Henderson trims Indian stock bets to chase ‘value’ in Korea,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 08:34:00 AM IST","Janus Henderson Investors has trimmed some of its exposure to Indian stocks in favor of South Korea on expectations of higher dividend returns.

“We have taken a reasonable amount off the total India allocation as we don’t want to miss out on the value rally in Korea,” Sat Duhra, a Singapore-based portfolio manager, said in an interview. South Korea’s high dividend yields and corporate reforms are seen boosting returns, he said.

South Korean authorities unveiled a “Corporate Value-Up Program” on Monday that seeks to incentivize companies that will prioritize shareholder returns. Korea’s Kospi benchmark offers a dividend yield of 2.45% based on one-year forward earnings, higher than the 1.5% yield offered by India’s Nifty 50 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Foreigners have plowed $7.7 billion into Korean stocks this year, more than any other emerging Asian markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They withdrew more than $3 billion from Indian stocks in the period.

Still, Duhra sees India as a “superior” macro-economic theme in comparison to any other Asian market, and said he will continue to keep his exposure to sectors such as utilities, information technology and banks.

We “just felt that if we’re going to play the dividends and reform theme, then we might as well do it in Korea, where the next six-to-12 months are far more compelling,” he said.

Get into consumer stocks; 2 stocks to buy as metals in a very sweet spot: Sanjiv Bhasin,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:39:00 AM IST","Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says “it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. We think the real income is going to be generated now from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where we are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.”

Bhasin also says “metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.”

Some of the consumer appliances companies, air-conditioner companies have had a very rough patch in the last few months. Voltas, Blue Star have come back. I would like to just bring to your notice a commentary coming in from one of the leading players last evening, which is Godrej Appliances. Yesterday, they said they are expecting 20% growth in the appliances business, including air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc, going into summer. If Godrej has visibility of 20% in appliances, it will surely rub off on the entire sector. Anything which you like there and what is your take on this commentary?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been stating that this is the time to be in consumer goods, whether white goods, staples, or even discretionary. Discretionary has outperformed as you are aware of two-wheeler and four-wheeler, but staples have hardly performed. So, we have been upbeat on Bata, Patanjali. We also own both Havells and Voltas and we think that the real income which is going to be generated now is from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where you are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.

Any thoughts on these two, Indostar and IB Housing?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We put our money in IB Housing at Rs 115, 120 when there was no promoter over there with more than 1% holding. Only institutions owned it and it was available almost for free and pessimism was at its highest as the old owners, Banga and the rest of them, had all exited. That was a time you should have been in this stock because the valuation comfort was at 0.4, 0.3 times price to book. Now, all those have made a comeback because NBFC has actually upped the ante and like you pointed out, the industry average is at 1.5, 1.7.

The risk to reward was very favourable and now there is a transition with a new name and new promoters. We did invest, but we have booked out of that. We are now invested in Indiabulls Real Estate, where Embassy’s takeover and the merger is just on the anvil. NCLT will give it by the middle of March and that could be a game changer.

You can imagine what Rs 6,000 crore market cap means for one of the largest marquee builder of property in both Maharashtra and Delhi and I think that Indiabulls Real Estate can be a big game changer here. It also trades at a market cap closer to Rs 5,000, 6,000 crore against even defaulters like Unitech and Parsvnath which have Rs 4,000-5,000 crore market cap. So, risk-reward is very favourable there. Indiabulls Housing Finance is going to be a game changer because of the new structure and over a period of time, it will deliver very good results. A disclosure, Indiabulls Real Estate is where we are very-very bullish.

What is happening to the overall airport economy? Today as well Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on DreamFolks and they are suggesting a target price which is almost 30% to 35% higher than the current market price. Do you think that the entire aviation, hospitality sector, DreamFolks, GMR Airports, have further room on the upside?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I used to stick my neck out because I travel so much pan-India that at 35, I used to say on TV khade honi ki jagha nahi hai airport pe, kaise GMR 35 rupaiya hai?( There’s no place to stand in the airport and GMR share price is Rs 35?). And lo and behold, look at the unlocking of the value. Aerocity is doing rocking business as far as the hotel business goes. They are selling more Black Label than ever. When luxury turns into necessity, then there is no stopping barrier for the expansion on the upside. Go to any airport, in the Bombay Airport Terminal 2, there is a one hour waiting list just to get through.

So, I think this is there to stay. You have to catch on to the right themes which you want to play. I will also take a word, you were mentioning on Vedanta, yesterday I was there at their presentation. The presentation was superb as far as both the non-ferrous and ferrous side.

People are not aware, but in India the largest nickel producer and the only nickel producer is Vedanta. From BALCO, there is aluminium, there is zinc from Hindustan Zinc. You name the product on the non-ferrous side, it is there. Aside from that, there is thermal power, there is gas, and there is energy. So, sum of the parts, the management has clearly indicated that they are not going to raise anything on the company as far as debt goes, they are only going to reduce that.

This morning, Mr Khara of SBI spoke to our colleagues that capacity utilisation across industries is now hitting the 75% mark or thereabout, that is exactly the level from which on green shoots of actual capex enquiries start coming in. He was very confident of 14% to 15% credit growth. SBI was the last mover in banks but has done pretty well. Would you latch on to SBI or some of the big PSU banks like BOB, Can Bank?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We had all of them, PNB, Can Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, part of it in our portfolio, part we booked. But we are more bullish on the private banks, the comfort of earnings, the comfort of CASA ratio and the credit expansion. The liability franchise is just a matter. So, HDFC, Axis, ICICI are our top holdings now and we continue to do SIPs on those. I will go by Mr Khara's word, but SBI has already made a first mover to 750, whereas HDFC and ICICI, Axis are now rearing to go.

I would say private banks will lead the Bank Nifty and I would be more overweight on the private banks. Also, I wish you well in your journey on the voyage on the ship. As a disclosure, ABSL AMC has been under my coverage on your channel from 350-400. Yesterday, it hit a high of 529. Do not sell it till it hits 750, that is my advice to investors.

Himachal political crisis: Who is Vikramaditya Singh creating all sorts of troubles for CM Sukhu?,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:43:00 PM IST","Former Himachal Pradesh minister and current Congress MLA, Vikramaditya Singh, who resigned from his ministerial post today, said that it is for the Congress party's high command to decide on the future course of action.

While replying to questions on his next move, Singh said, “it is for the party’s high command to decide on the future course of action.""

""I never was under pressure during my ministerial position; I am the one who creates pressure,” he added.

The ruling dispensation in Himachal Pradesh suffered a massive setback on Tuesday when it lost the state's lone Rajya Sabha seat to the BJP. Interestingly, former Congressman Harsh Mahajan beat another Congress stalwart Abhishek Manu Singhvi, which deepened the crisis for Congress in the state, and it could face a no-trust motion in the assembly.

Who is Vikramaditya Singh?
Born on October 17, 1989, Vikramaditya Singh belongs to the royal Rajput family of the princely state of Bushahr in Himachal Pradesh. He is the son of former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, the late Virbhadra Singh, one of the most popular leaders of the hill state, who had been CM of Himachal six times. Meanwhile, his mother, Pratibha Singh, is a Member of Parliament from Mandi's Lok Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh.

After the demise of his father in 2021, Vikramaditya was crowned the titular king of the erstwhile princely state of Bushahr. He did his early schooling at Shimla's Bishop Cotton School and then completed his graduation and post-graduation from Delhi University in history.

Vikramaditya took a plunge into politics in 2013 when he was elected as Himachal Pradesh State Youth Congress president. He then fought and won the election from Shimla Rural constituency as the Member of Legislative Assembly in 2017 for the first time. He reclaimed the seat again in 2022, and he was given the portfolio of minister of PWD, youth services and sports, and urban development minister in the Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government.

Defied the Congress' diktat on Ram Mandir
Last month, Vikramaditya hit the headlines when he defied his party's stance and visited the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Since his visit to Ayodhya, the rumour mill has been in overdrive over his displeasure with the Sukhu-led government, and now the differences are out there in the open.

"Sensex plunges 790 points, smallcaps bleed most. 6 factors behind Rs 6 lakh crore crash","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:31:00 PM IST","Just ahead of the monthly derivative expiry, Nifty gave up its hold over the 22,000 level while Sensex ended the day 790 points or 1% weaker. The sell-off was deeper in the broader market where midcaps, smallcaps and microcap indices fell around 2% each. In the process, Dalal Street investors were left poorer by about Rs 6 lakh crore as the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks fell to Rs 386 lakh crore.

Nifty has been consolidating in a sideways move but consistent closure above 22,000 for eight consecutive sessions had suggested a prevailing positive trend. Technical analysts believe that if the breakout below 22,000 sustains, it could trigger a directional move on the downside.

""Nifty managed to close just above the 21EMA on the daily timeframe. Observing the daily chart, the index has been navigating within a rising channel. A decline below 21,950 could potentially trigger a correction towards 21,800 in the near term. Conversely, a sustained trade above 21,950 might spur a recovery in the index towards 22,100,"" said Rupak De of LKP Securities.

Derivative data revealed a shift in momentum from CE to PE near the monthly expiry, with Open Interest witnessing increased strength in weakness. Heavy writing was seen in 22100 CE and 22200 CE.




In the context of froth building up in small and midcap segments of the market and the continuing flows in the small and midcap schemes, markets regulator Sebi has asked mutual fund houses to put in place a policy to protect the interest of all investors. Suggested measures include moderating inflows, portfolio rebalancing, etc.

Industry association AMFI said AMCs have also been asked to ensure that investors are protected from the first mover advantage of redeeming investors.




Traders are waiting for the release of US' personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) data for January, which could influence Fed rate hikes. Hopes of a rate cut in the June meeting has reduced to 59%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""Global investors are awaiting the key US economic data like personal consumption expenditure, in anticipation of good forecast there is a fear that Fed rate cut maybe delayed,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, .


With the market cap-to-GDP ratio zooming above 120%, investors have been finding little comfort in valuations, more so in the broader market. After the end of the December quarter earnings season, expectations for FY25 have not moved much on aggregate.




MSCI's gauge of emerging market stocks was down 0.7% at a one-week low amid weakness in heavyweight Asian bourses. Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.5%, while the Shanghai Composite sank 1.9% amid turmoil in China's property sector.


A part of the volatility in the market today is also attributed to the monthly F&O expiry tomorrow.

""For February monthly series, 22,200 call has significant open interest, followed by 22,300 strikes. On the put side, 22,200 has significant open interest, followed by 22,100 strike implying the zone of 22,140-22,120 will act as immediate support for the index. While, on the upside the level of 22,270 will act as immediate resistance for the index,"" SBI Securities said.

"ICICI Bank branch manager forged signatures, siphoned off 'Rs 11.95 crore' by transfer and cash, alleges the customer; case in EOW's net","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 06:52:00 PM IST","The branch manager of an ICICI Bank branch has admitted having committed fraud by forging the signature of an NRI customer. In a complaint letter dated January 6, 2024, to Vikas Puri Police Station in Delhi, ICICI Bank said, ""It is pertinent to mention that the overdraft facility (amounting to Rs 2.7 crore) was created by Varun Vashishta, Branch manager, ICICI Bank Vikas Puri Branch by forging signature of customer on overdraft account opening form. Further it was found that a total amount of Rs 2.68 crore siphoned off from the account.""

The bank had urged via this letter to the police to register an FIR in this case. While the initial amount of fraud was estimated to be around Rs 2.68 crore, further investigation by the complainant bank revealed that the overall amount of fraud could be close to Rs 12 crore. This amount could go up further to around Rs 16 crore if the interest amount is also included. It is being alleged that the fraud started in 2019 and only recently came to light when the victim NRI customer of the bank complained about this embezzlement.

Where did the bank branch manager syphon off money from the customer's a/c to?
According to the complaint filed by the victim NRI customer dated January 29, 2024 addressed to Economic Offences Wing (EOW), 43 beneficiaries were identified till date who had received money at various times from the NRE bank account of the complainant without authorisation. She further alleged that cash to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore was withdrawn from her account over the years and about Rs 9.5 crore was transferred to the said 43 beneficiaries.

Why did such a scam go unnoticed for years?
The complainant's husband runs a hotel in Delhi and a point-of-sale machine (POS), and the current account of the said hotel were held at this branch of ICICI Bank. The complainant claimed that money was being deposited regularly in an NRE bank account held at the Vikaspuri branch of ICICI Bank since 2019.

The victim NRI customer revealed in the letter to the EOW that fixed deposit (FD) receipts were handed over by the ICICI Bank manager of Vikas Puri branch, with the stamp of ICICI Bank, and it was also emailed from the official Email ID of the bank branch manager. ""We never visited the bank branch nor suspected the FDs to be fraudulent since the bank's branch manager used to visit us in our home and handover the FD receipts and also emailed the same receipts with the bank's seal from the bank's official email ID. These FD receipts and interest certificates were forged which we recently learned. I recently learned that my account was being managed by ICICI Bank Gurgaon branch whereas I was under the impression that my bank account was being managed by ICICI Bank Vikaspuri branch. No official from the ICICI Bank Gurgaon branch ever contacted me,"" said the complainant exclusively To ET Online when asked.

Bank says it's difficult for things to remain unnoticed for long
In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for ICICI Bank has said, ""The Bank has consistently sent transaction details to her registered mobile number and email id since the accounts were opened a few years ago. It is bewildering that the customer claims to be unaware of these transactions and balances in her account over the past three years, and she only recently noticed a discrepancy in her account balance. This discrepancy ought to have been observed by the customer when filing Income Tax returns (ITR) as well.""

ITR may not necessarily compel customer to check FD details
Customers don't need to check NRE FD details at the time of filing ITR because interest earned on NRE deposits are exempted from income tax. ""Unlike a normal resident bank account fixed deposit (FDs) of where Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is deducted if interest on FD exceeds Rs 40,000 a year (in case of Senior Citizen limit is Rs 50,000), in NRE bank accounts, no TDS is deducted however much the amount of interest is. This is because it is exempt from income tax,"" says chartered accountant Mihir Tanna, associate director, S.K. Patodia LLP, a CA firm.

Branch manager changed mobile number and email address
The aggrieved customer alleged that she received certain notifications/email alerts about cash withdrawals made in her bank account. However, when she confronted the ICICI Bank branch manager about these alerts, he dismissed these 'notification alerts' from ICICI Bank as fraudulent phishing emails and to not open them further. In the letter to EOW, the complainant said, ""I used to immediately inform Mr. Varun Vashisht on phone and WhatsApp about such alerts. However, every time I informed Mr. Varun Vashishta about any such notification, he warned that these were 'fraud phishing' mails which many customers are getting and was asked not to click or open any such email.""

Responding to these allegations, the spokesperson for ICICI Bank said, ""She alleges that the mobile number and email ID of her account were changed without her knowledge. However, our records indicate that notifications regarding both changes were sent to her original mobile number and email address which were registered with the Bank. Furthermore, the new number is listed on the website of a company owned by the customer herself.""

What did ICICI Bank do after being informed about the scam?
The spokesperson for ICICI Bank said, ""As an aggrieved party, we have lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EoW) of Delhi Police for a thorough investigation into the matter. We are extending full cooperation to the Police investigation. We have communicated to the customer that we are ready to transfer the disputed amount of Rs 9.27 crore (she has already encashed a fixed deposit of Rs 2 crore) to her account with a lien, pending the outcome of the investigation (by EOW).""

The case, which was first investigated by the Vikas Puri Police Station in Delhi, has now been transferred to the EOW. ET Online tried getting the initial views of the EOW officials investigating the matter, however, they did not want to comment on any ongoing investigation and hence, refrained from giving a statement about the case.

"We have a Nifty target of 24,000 in CY24, a 9% upside from current levels: Seshadri Sen","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:28:00 PM IST","Seshadri Sen, Head of Research, Emkay Global Financial Services, says “we will be overweight IT when valuations revert back to our side when the largecaps touch the low 20s or even below. But otherwise, what will happen is that sure fundamentals will turn around, but the stocks have already discounted that by valuations getting pushed up towards the end of calendar 23. Stock performance will remain a little anaemic which underpins our underweight IT call.”

Sen says “the two sectors that we really like are a manufacturing-led cycle for India. So, by and large, we think manufacturing will outperform services. And within that, we are industrials, consumer, discretionary, and materials are three sectors that we like.”


How do you see the market breadth as well as the market movement as of now because on the index level, what we are seeing today is purely an expiry play. Do you believe that the longer term trend, which is a bull run of course, is there and we are looking out for good gains there?
Seshadri Sen: Our view is that we are going to see moderate gains, especially in the larger cap space in this calendar year. We have a Nifty target of 24,000, which is about 9% upside from current levels. We have also additionally said that in the first quarter you will see volatility so days like this will happen because we entered the quarter with a very strong run up in the October-December quarter before this.

Therefore, you are going to see a little bit of volatility and sideways movement in the broader indices in the first part of the year. Most of this 9% return will be punched towards the middle of the year, between April and September, when we have multiple triggers. You will see the election results. You are going to see the budget by the new government in July. We are still pencilling in a rate cut in some time in that period as well. All of this will come in and then the returns will start to peter out towards the end of the year. We are not surprised that we are seeing a little bit of volatility in the first quarter that is broadly what we expected. We remain constructive and positive on the broader markets in India. But we think most of the returns will come after April.

What I can say is that you remain underweight in the IT space. Just a couple of days back, we had some brokerages which are still bullish on the IT space and specifically willing to be with the leaders. How do you see the construct of the IT space as of now because just in the last earnings, we have seen a lot of stocks and the analysts getting back to their confidence levels in the IT space that maybe it is the time to accumulate the IT space? But what is your rationale?
Seshadri Sen: In IT, one has to look at it in two parts. So first is fundamentals, IT is going through a cyclical downturn at the moment. But we expect that if the US economy stays strong and or if there are rate cuts in the middle of the year by the Fed, you will see a recovery in the overall growth dynamics for IT towards the end of the year.

We are not too worried about the current cyclical downturn. However, we have seen, especially in the post-Covid period, that most of the money in IT is made when the valuations change. The long-term compounding of earnings in that sector is not particularly exciting. It is a great sector. It is growing very well. It throws out a lot of cash.

But you make money when the valuation changes. So, we will be overweight IT when valuations revert back to our side when the large caps maybe touch the low 20s or even below. But otherwise, we think that what will happen is that sure fundamentals will turn around, but the stocks have already discounted that by valuations getting pushed up towards the end of calendar 23. Stock performance will remain a little anaemic which underpins our underweight IT call.

Since 24,000 is what you are eyeing for Nifty 50, which sectors do you believe will lead Nifty to those levels? Which sectors are you still bullish on?
Seshadri Sen: The two sectors that we really like are a manufacturing-led cycle for India. So, by and large, we think manufacturing will outperform services. And within that, we are industrials, consumer, discretionary, and materials are three sectors that we like.

Consumer discretionary, especially since I think autos and auto ancillaries are almost 60% of that sector if you look at Nifty, if I remember right. And that is one area overall that we like. We know autos and auto ancillaries that will lead. Industrials and materials is the other way to play the manufacturing cycle. We think that services like financial services and IT will lag this bull market. We have already seen some of that happen, and that will continue in the medium term.

There have been widespread media speculation that Michelle Obama is poised to enter the 2024 Presidential Election arena and potentially face off against former US President Donald Trump.

In January, Michelle Obama had expressed fear about the 2024 election and said that it 'haunts' her sleep. She said she was terrified that Donald Trump would win.

""What's going to happen in this next election? I'm terrified about what could possibly happen, because our leaders matter,"" Michelle had said in a podcast interview last month.

Pause in repo rate hike has boosted homebuyers' sentiment
The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) last increased the repo rate, by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.5%, in February 2023. Since then, the central bank has kept the repo rate unchanged. Home buyers were adversely affected with an overall hike of 2.5% on their home loans and were waiting for the interest rate to fall. However, back-to-back pause in the repo rate for the last year, the sentiment of homebuyers, said many experts. ""This is a win-win situation for both builders and buyers,"" said Rohan Khatau, Director of CCI Projects. “For builders, it means more liquidity and lower financing costs. For buyers, it ensures that home loans remain affordable.”

Samyak Jain, Director of Siddha Group, said, ""Homebuyers stand to benefit from this decision as it implies stable loan interest rates. The unchanged policy rates mean that the cost of borrowing will not increase, making it an opportune time for potential homeowners to secure loans at attractive rates.""",The economic times
Govt plans to feed poll campaign with its Bharat staples,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 01:18:00 AM IST","New Delhi: The government is looking at ways to give a big push to its Bharat staples brand, under which it sells atta, rice and pulses in the retail market at subsidised rates, ahead of the general elections in April-May.

""The plan is to carpet bomb Bharat brand products in every assembly constituency before the elections,"" said a senior official aware of the government's plan, adding that the mandate is to take it to as many consumers as possible.

The three agencies - Kendriya Bhandar, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) - through which the Bharat products are sold have been asked to sell 300,000-400,000 metric tonnes of rice and atta every month, said the people cited above. Equal emphasis has to be given to pulses also, they added.

The retail prices of several essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses, onions, tomatoes soared last year due to reduced production.



Cheer for Farmers and Consumers
This kept food inflation elevated throughout the year, following which the government started selling these products in the retail market.

While it began selling chana dal at a subsidised rate in July 2023 under Bharat brand when retail prices of tur (arhar) rose sharply, Bharat Atta was launched in November 2023 and Bharat Rice in February 2024 to contain prices.

Products under the Bharat brand are priced significantly lower than those of others. For instance, Bharat Rice is sold at ₹29 per kg while other branded rice is sold at ₹40 to ₹110 per kg.

Similarly, Bharat Atta and Bharat Chana Dal are sold at ₹27.5 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. Other branded atta is sold for over Rs 40 a kg and chana dal at over Rs 100 a kg.

"'Unacceptable, we were wrong"": Under-fire Google CEO Pichai reacts to Gemini AI fall-out","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:47:00 AM IST","Following severe backlash from communities across various social media platforms regarding Gemini, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly addressed the issue and said that the problematic responses around race were ""unacceptable"".

The Google CEO addressed these concerns via a memo, as per Semafor.
Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours

“I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias – to be clear, that’s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong,” Pichai said.

""Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We’re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts,” he said.

""No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we’ll review what happened and make sure we fix it at scale,"" he reportedly said.

ETOnline has not independently verified this information.

Google Gemini controversy
Google has been on the receiving end of severe backlash following certain responses from its AI outlet which has reportedly shown racial bias, among other problematic issues. In one case, it even said that ""It is not possible to say who definitively impacted society more, Elon (Musk) tweeting memes or Hitler,"" the AI software said in its response.

This controversy has prompted the question of the risks of AI when programmed with a bias, given how quickly it is permeating our day to day lives.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Elon Musk accused Google of running a ""racist, anti-civilisational programming"" with its AI models. ""Google Gemini is super racist and sexist. This just shows more and more how Gemini is programmed with the exact same narratives that our higher education teaches.""

Alphabet's Google began offering image generation through its Gemini AI models earlier this month. Some users, however, flagged on social media that it generated historical images which were sometimes inaccurate. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software to rival that of the Microsoft-backed company.

Bard was renamed Gemini earlier this month and Google rolled out paid subscription plans, which users could choose for better reasoning capabilities from the AI model.

“It’s clear that this feature missed the mark,” said a blog post Friday from Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president who runs Google’s search engine and other businesses. ""Some of the images generated are inaccurate or even offensive. We’re grateful for users’ feedback and are sorry the feature didn’t work well,

Google added the new image-generating feature to its Gemini chatbot, formerly known as Bard, about three weeks ago. It was built atop an earlier Google research experiment called Imagen 2.

Google has known for a while that such tools can be unwieldly. In a 2022 technical paper, the researchers who developed Imagen warned that generative AI tools can be used for harassment or spreading misinformation “and raise many concerns regarding social and cultural exclusion and bias.” Those considerations informed Google’s decision not to release “a public demo” of Imagen or its underlying code, the researchers added at the time.

Steps should also be taken to ensure that investors are protected from the first mover advantage of redeeming investors, it said while directing that the policy should be approved and disclosed on each AMC's website within the next 3 weeks.

The regulator's directive, which was communicated to all MF houses, sparked selling pressure in the market with the Sensex falling over 800 points while Nifty also fell 1% to give its hold on the 22,000-level.

Indices related to smallcap, midcaps and microcaps fell over 2% as Sebi's directive may reduce the pace of flow of funds in the broader market.



In the last year, smaller stocks have led the upside on Dalal Street to make the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks closer to the $5 trillion mark. Nifty Microcap 250 index has almost doubled in valued in the last 12 months. Nifty Smallcap 50 is up 77% and Nifty Midcap50 has rallied 62% during the period vs Nifty's 26% gain.

Value investors have been warning against the froth building up in smaller stocks as retail investors are betting directly on (without figuring out PE or PB levels) as well as through smallcap MFs.

""Retail investors’ ownership of the smallcap segment has also become sizeable, crossing even institutional ownership in many stocks. Institutional investors, like mutual funds, exercise broad controls and invest in a disciplined manner. However, momentum chasing by investors, coupled with limited free float available in the market, has created valuation distortions in a few cases. Such experience is further boosting investors’ confidence, over-shadowing the caution required,"" Kotak Mutual Fund said.

Kotak had recently announced that it will restrict flows into its smallcap scheme from March 4. The fund house said fresh subscriptions through lumpsums will be restricted for each investor to Rs 2 lakh per month while SIPs are limited to Rs 25,000 per month.

Various fund houses like , Tata and Nippon do not accept lumpsum investments in their smallcap schemes.

“In my opinion there is a strong possibility that many funds will be influenced to halt for some time from accepting lump sum investments in these segments. SIP flows shouldn’t be impacted,” Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research said.

Analysts suggest keeping a moderate overweight stance on largecap stocks, equal weight on midcap stocks, and moderate underweight on .

Investor money worth about Rs 2.5 lakh crore is riding on smallcap funds, which form about of the total equity AUM.",The economic times

RIL-Disney deal: Nita Ambani may be named chairperson,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:52:00 AM IST","Nita Ambani, founder and chairperson of Reliance Foundation, is likely to become the chairperson of Star India-Viacom18 merged entity, while Bodhi Tree promoter Uday Shankar could be named the vice chairperson, people privy to the development told ET.

Ambani has been deeply involved in Reliance's sports initiatives including the Indian Premier League team, Mumbai Indians, and Indian Super League, which incidentally is a 65:35 JV between Reliance and Disney. She is also the first Indian woman to be elected as a member of the International Olympic Committee.

didn't respond to ET's queries.

As reported earlier by ET, the mega-merger deal between Star India and Viacom18 has been concluded. The contours of the deal have been finalised and it is expected to be announced on Wednesday, the people said.

""Nita Ambani and Uday Shankar will be the chairperson and vice chairperson of the merged entity,"" said one of the persons cited above. The person added that Shankar is likely to be Reliance's nominee on the merged entity's board.

The sole board seat given to Bodhi Tree is likely to be taken up by its investor, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the person said.

INQ Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QIA, had last year invested in Bodhi Tree Systems.

Both Reliance and Disney have set an ambitious deadline for completing the merger by October, another person stated.

However, legal experts cautioned that the completion of the merger will depend on the time it takes to receive Competition Commission of India (CCI) clearance. ""Most merger deals have a two- to three-year sunset clause. This will be no different,"" the person cited above said.

People earlier told ET that Reliance may own 61% of the proposed combined company, with Disney holding 33% and Bodhi Tree having the remaining 6%.

Shari Redstone-promoted Paramount Global, a shareholder in Viacom18, is set to exit the company with Reliance buying its stake. Reliance is expected to invest $1-2 billion, primarily for infusing growth capital into the merged entity and the buyout of Paramount's stake.",The economic times
How Ram Lalla helped BJP win Uttar Pradesh Rajya Sabha elections,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:33:00 PM IST","The victory of Sanjay Seth, the eighth candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Rajya Sabha elections held in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, can be attributed to the support of Ram Lalla. Despite facing challenges, the BJP managed to secure the votes of seven Samajwadi Party (SP) MLAs, which played a crucial role in Seth's win. Seth received 29 first preference votes, while SP's candidate Alok Ranjan only received 19 votes.

The BJP's strategy to identify these seven SP legislators was a joint effort by key government figures, including Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and ministers Suresh Khanna and JPS Rathore. State party chief Bhupendra Chaudhary and general secretary (organisation) Dharampal were also involved in the process.

The task was simplified as the BJP focused on SP MLAs who had openly supported the consecration of Ram Lalla's idol at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22. A BJP leader stated, 'We approached those MLAs who had strongly supported the consecration event, despite the party's silence on the issue. Many of them responded positively.'

Rakesh Pratap Singh, Abhay Singh, Vinod Chaturvedi, and Manoj Pandey were among the identified SP legislators. After the announcement of the RS election results, Abhay Singh tweeted, 'Voting was conducted transparently. We voted according to our will. After the opening of the Ram Temple, the Assembly Speaker invited all MLAs for darshan, but the SP stopped its legislators. This was not right.'

Similarly, Raghuraj Pratap Singh, founder of Jansatta Dal, became an accessible target for BJP leaders seeking support due to his vocal support for Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Yogi after the consecration ceremony.

"DMK newspaper ad shows 'China rocket': PM Modi slams party, says 'insulted scientists'","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 05:10:00 PM IST","A controversy has erupted over a newspaper advertisement in Tamil Nadu. The advertisement, featuring images of both Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister M K Stalin, prominently displays a rocket in the background. This has sparked a debate as one of the rockets in the image bears a Chinese flag on its nose cone, while the others display Chinese characters.

The ad was allegedly issued by the minister for fisheries and animal husbandry Anitha R Radhakrishnan on Wednesday ahead of the inauguration of a new launch complex at Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin district by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Meanwhile, PM Modi lashed out on the DMK govt at the state saying that the ad insulted Indian scientists and is a waste of public money.

""DMK is a party that does not work but stands ahead to take false credit. These people paste their stickers on our schemes. Now they have crossed the limits, they have pasted China's sticker to take credit for the ISRO launch pad in Tamil Nadu,"" PM Modi said while addressing a gathering in Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu.

The Prime Minister alleged that the DMK is 'not ready' to accept India's progress in the space sector.

""They are not ready to accept India's progress in the space sector and with the taxes that you pay, they give advertisements and do not even include a picture of India's space in it. They did not want to present India's space success in front of the world, they insulted our scientists, our space sector, and your tax money. Now it's high time that the DMK is punished for their deeds,"" PM Modi said.


DMK MP K Kanimozhi, however, defended the party. ""I don't know from where the person who did the artwork found this picture,"" Kanimozhi said while speaking to reporters outside Chennai airport on Wednesday. ""I don't think India has declared China an enemy country. I have seen that the Prime Minister has invited the Chinese PM and they have gone to Mahabalipuram. Just because you do not want to accept the truth, you are finding reasons to divert the issue,"" the DMK leader said.


Earlier, Modi also lashed out at the Congress and DMK and accused the alliance parties of engaging in 'dividing' the nation.

""India celebrated the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. A few days ago, a resolution was moved in Parliament regarding the same. All the members of DMK left the house. This behaviour shows how much the DMK leaders despise your faith,"" he said.

""DMK and Congress are hell-bent on dividing the nation. Whereas, the BJP considers every person a family member,"" the Prime Minister said.

He expressed confidence that people in the state look up to BJP for development.

""Children, old people, youth, women, poor and middle class, every section, every society of Tamil Nadu is coming with BJP with full confidence today. People of Tamil Nadu are looking at BJP with great hopes. People are seeing how BJP has taken forward the positive politics of sensitivity and social justice in the country,"" he said.

""This immense love and trust of Tamil Nadu is a big responsibility for us. People see how the BJP has promoted the positive politics of sensitivity and social justice. I guarantee you, the BJP will leave no stone unturned to rise up to your expectations,"" PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister highlighted the proposal for AIIMS to be built in Madurai while accusing the state government of 'non-cooperation.'

""Today, if the country moves forward 100 steps, then Tamil Nadu should also move forward with the same speed, this is Modi's resolve. Therefore, if we have opened many new AIIMS in the country in the last 10 years, then we are going to open AIIMS in Madurai also,"" he said.

""Today, if every poor person in the country is getting guaranteed free treatment up to Rs five lakh, then more than 50 lakh beneficiaries are our brothers and sisters from Tamil Nadu. And we are doing this service when there is a government in the state which is not ready to cooperate with us even for the interest of Tamil Nadu,"" PM Modi outlined.

He also criticised the DMK government of standing against development of the state while vowing to return to power on them.

""Therefore, you all need to be alert from the state government that is opposed to the development of Tamil Nadu and such anti-development political parties and now demand an account from them,"" he said.

Congress-Left allies in different states but will oppose each other in Kerala: Jairam Ramesh,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:47:00 PM IST","With the CPI declaring Annie Raja its candidate from Kerala's Wayanad, the Congress Wednesday said it is in alliance with the Left in different states but they have always and will continue to oppose each other electorally in Kerala.

Blow-off rallies in individual segments once complete should lead to a prolonged market correction: Rohit Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 03:19:00 PM IST","Rohit Srivastava, Strike Money Analytics & Indiacharts, says “almost Rs 50,000 crore of that just got added in the last one month. This is huge, it is probably one of the largest futures expiry that we are seeing happening right now, which is probably one of the reasons why there is some pressure because there is a very huge rollover that has to happen and we will see how that goes. But the very size of the positioning is a risk to the market itself.”

Does it seem there are some signs of consolidation currently in the market or do you expect this to reverse and the market could even claim new highs even going forward now?
Rohit Srivastava: No, I do not think this is a routine correction or consolidation. I think that this is a topping process of the market. This is the third attempt that the Nifty has made since January to go above 22,130. It failed the first and the second time. The third time we did see it close above that for a couple of days and again we are below that.

Now, of course, the final confirmation to what I am seeing will come if it breaks the 20-day average as well, which is at 21,950. But the setup looks like a slow and steady distribution happening during this time period because different sectors are weakening from time to time and starting to decline.

We have seen some sectors outperform during the one, one-and-a-half month period, but I think that has not really led to the Nifty taking off which is basically a sign that these are last flash rallies, blow off rallies in individual segments that are happening, which once complete should lead to a much more prolonged corrective phase or correction in the market, which has not happened in quite a while. That is what we are looking for. It is something a little more reasonable in terms of correction.

So, not much of an excitement that you are expecting, at least from the next series, that is the March series?
Rohit Srivastava: No, I do not think so because we have seen two months of strong upticks. Positioning is very high. If you have actually looked at the futures open interest, it touched Rs 4,08,000 crore. That is the total stock and index futures combined yesterday, that is almost 18 times the value of the index. Now, when was the last time we had 18 times the value of the index in stock and index futures? The answer is somewhere between December and Jan of 2008.

So, that is the significance of how much position people have taken. In fact, almost Rs 50,000 crore of that just got added in the last one month. This is huge, it is probably one of the largest futures expiry that we are seeing happening right now, which is probably one of the reasons why there is some pressure because there is a very huge rollover that has to happen and we will see how that goes. But the very size of the positioning is a risk to the market itself.

Stock specific, have you looked into Max Financial’s chart? It is one of the top F&O gainers in trade today and the stock seems to have taken support around its 100 DMA. How is that stock looking like?
Rohit Srivastava: Not on my tracking list right now, but I would not be taking any bullish views on anything right now.

And sector specific, what we are seeing today is that the real estate sector has been one of the star performers of 2023 and of late also in 2024, the index has been running on the higher side, it is now the top loser. In fact, it is down around 2.5%. What is that sector looking like? What is that index looking like?
Rohit Srivastava: Not very great, I would say. It has had a good run. But we should have come close to ending the rally in realty stocks as well. It may not be the weakest sector, though for today it may be weak, the place people should look for weakness is where there has been the maximum weakness on a one month and a one-week basis and that would slightly point you to slightly different sectors.

For example, on a one-month basis, it is media and FMCG and on a one-week basis, it is oil and gas, Nifty Bank and those are probably places where further weakness could show up. So, we will have to really focus on those segments. But realty, as you mentioned, it does look like the best should be done for this current move.

The IT sector has been bucking that trend today. Would you rather be stock specific when it comes to the IT sector or are you bullish on the IT sector?
Rohit Srivastava: No, we are not. Slightly more medium term, I would not be very bullish on IT stocks right now. You notice that even though IT stocks have come up, they are still below the high that they made in 2022. So, it has not been a very strong move. It has been a very major attempt to come back, but not strong enough to say that they are out of the woods, which is why it is still a lot of headwinds still for IT. So, that is not a place I would want to really focus on.

"Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019: What's CAA, NRC? How it will impact and why is it seen as a problem?","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 04:01:00 PM IST","In 2019, widespread protests, some of them violent, erupted across India against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. This Act has once again grabbed headlines amidst reports indicating the government's intention to notify it before the Lok Sabha Elections 2024. The legislation aims to redefine the status of illegal immigrants for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, and Christian migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, who have resided in India without proper documentation. They are slated to be granted expedited Indian citizenship within six years, deviating from the previous norm of a 12-year residency requirement for naturalization.

Who comes under CAA?
Following the parliamentary approval of the CAA in December 2019 and subsequent presidential consent, demonstrations flared up in locations like Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and Assam's Guwahati. These protests, which resulted in over a hundred casualties from clashes with law enforcement or other causes, gradually waned amidst the COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown measures.

What is Centre's logic behind the CAA?
The CAA targets individuals ""forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion,"" intending to shield them from illegal migration proceedings. The cutoff date for citizenship eligibility is December 31, 2014, requiring applicants to have entered India on or before that date. Presently, Indian citizenship is granted to those born in India or who have resided in the country for a minimum of 11 years. Additionally, the proposed amendment includes a provision for the cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration if the OCI cardholder violates any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other applicable law.

CAA: Some say it is like Partition, is that true?
The government asserts that the minority groups covered by the CAA have fled persecution in Muslim-majority nations. However, critics question the consistency of this logic, highlighting the exclusion of certain religious minorities and neighboring regions facing similar issues. Despite this, the government has not provided satisfactory answers to these concerns.

How much of Northeast does the CAA cover?
While the CAA does not apply to regions under the sixth schedule of the Constitution or states with inner-line permit regimes, Assam has witnessed particularly fervent opposition. Fear persists that regularizing illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh under the CAA could threaten the cultural and linguistic fabric of the state.

Why is Assam angry about CAA?
Unlike the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which focused on identifying illegal immigrants without regard to religion, the CAA has drawn criticism for allegedly discriminating against Muslims, thus infringing upon the fundamental right to equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution. Despite opposition claims, the government maintains its stance on the legality and fairness of the CAA.

Isn't it the same like the NRC?
Although the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, received presidential assent on December 12, the Home Ministry has yet to notify the operational rules. Recent reports suggest that the government plans to finalize these rules before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.

Byju’s US lenders invoke parent company's guarantee in insolvency proceedings,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 07:52:00 PM IST","The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday told Byju’s to respond to two separate insolvency petitions filed against the troubled edtech firm by US lenders and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

In the first matter, the Bengaluru bench of NCLT provided Byju’s parent Think & Learn three weeks from now to file its objections to a petition filed by Glas Trust Company LLC, the administrative agent appointed by a group of lenders that had extended a $1.2-billion term loan B to its US subsidiary Alpha Inc to collect the debt under the guarantee agreement.

In the matter involving Glas Trust, the tribunal has issued a notice to the embattled edtech firm for payment defaults of the loan that it had guaranteed.

The petitioner – that claims to collectively own more than 85% of the term loan B – invoked the guarantee provided by Think & Learn.

In a separate case, BCCI’s counsel on Wednesday told the Bengaluru bench of NCLT that Byju’s has not yet paid pending due of Rs 158 crore.

The counsel claimed that Byju’s had already deducted tax deducted at source (TDS) against invoices that it received from BCCI, but it never paid the invoice amount to the cricket board.

The dispute is over Byju’s team India jersey sponsorship deal signed with the Indian cricket board in 2019.

The BCCI counsel told NCLT that Byju’s had asked it to encash Rs 143 crore performance bank guarantee, which the edtech firm had provided, and said the remaining amount will be paid later.

The tribunal on Wednesday provided time to BCCI’s counsel to file the judgments, and Byju’s counsel to file a comprehensive reply after that.

Amid a worsening business demand for players operating in the business-to-consumer K-12 business post-Covid, Byju’s has found itself in multiple tussles ranging from non-payment of several dues, employee salaries, incessant layoffs and a much-delayed reporting of its financials among other matters.

On January 25, the group of US lenders had first petitioned the bankruptcy court in India to initiate insolvency proceedings against Think & Learn, exacerbating the challenges for a company that is desperately scouting for funds to keep operations running amid a slowdown in the edtech sector and regulatory scrutiny.

The lenders have been in negotiation with the company over prepayment of a $1.2-billion term loan taken by Byju's Alpha even as the two sides also continued to fight a legal battle in US courts.

The counsel for Glas Trust told the court that Byju’s Alpha owes money to about 100 lenders.

In a separate case, the NCLT on Tuesday asked the cash-strapped edtech firm and a group of its shareholders opposing its $200-million rights issue to file written submissions within three days, and reserved its order on a plea for interim relief.

In its order, made available on Wednesday, it has directed, ""the funds received by the respondent company in respect to the rights issue should be kept in a separate escrow account and it should not be withdrawn till the disposal of this matter relating to the rights issue in the court. It added that Byju's counsel had also given an undertaking that there will be no allotment of shares without increasing the authorised share capital of the company.",The economic times
"Russia diverts LNG supplies for Asia around Africa to avoid Red Sea, LSEG data shows","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:34:00 PM IST","Russia is diverting China-bound cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a longer route via the Cape of Good Hope due to the heightened risk of attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, LSEG data showed.

Global fuel producers, including Russia, were forced to change the way they deliver to Asia and go around Africa to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea despite the Suez canal being the shortest route between Asia and Europe.
Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours

The conflict has also pushed up insurance premiums for ships taking the Red Sea route, adding to costs.

The extended route to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope will add about 10 days to the journey, something that could worsen a shortage of tankers Russia is already facing due to Western sanctions.

According to LSEG data, tanker LNG Geneva, loaded on Jan. 3 with Russian LNG from Yamal ship-to-ship (STS) near Kildin Island in the Murmansk region was heading around Africa and unloaded on Feb. 16 at the Jieyang terminal in China.

Another tanker, Clean Vision, which was carrying Russian gas from Novatek Yamal LNG, was loaded on Jan. 17 and is heading towards China where it is expected to unload on Feb. 28.

Vessels carrying LNG from Yamal, which were loaded in December last year and delivered fuel to China via the Red Sea route are heading back around Africa, LSEG data shows.

Novatek did not respond to a Reuters request.

Novatek used to supply its LNG to Asia via the Suez Canal when navigation along the Northern Sea Route was closed during the winter months.

Russia plans to establish year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route.

In January 2024, exports from Yamal LNG have totalled about 1.8 million metric tons. That figure fell to 1.46 million metric tons in February, according to LSEG data.

Qatar, one of the world's biggest LNG exporters, informed Italy's Edison and other buyers in Europe in January that its LNG cargoes would take a longer route via the Cape of Good Hope due to the Red Sea crisis.

"Himachal Pradesh Assembly Speaker suspends 15 BJP MLAs, state minister Vikramaditya Singh steps down","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:36:00 PM IST","The political drama in Himachal Pradesh took a fresh turn after state assembly speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania suspended 15 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs from the house allegedly for creating ruckus in his chamber.

The 15 BJP MLA's who were suspended from the House include Jai Ram Thakur, Vipin Parmar, Randhir Sharma, Hans Raj, Vinod Kumar, Janak Raj, Balbir Verma, Lokinder Kumar, Trilok Jamwal, Surinder Shourie, Puran Chand, Dalip Thakur, Inder Singb Gandhi, Ranbir Nikka and Deep Raj.

Meanwhile, Vikramaditya Singh, a state minister and the son of the former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh stepped down from his position, a day after the Rajya Sabha election result in the state.

""The (state) government failed to find even a small piece of land on Mall Road to install the statue of a person (Virbhadra Singh) who was the CM of Himachal Pradesh six times, because of whom this government was formed,"" he said.

He said, ""All I would like to say is that under the current circumstances, it is not correct for me to continue as a part of the government. So, I have decided that I am resigning from the Council of Ministers. I am resigning as a minister. In the time to come, I will have video consultations with my people and then decide about the future course of action...""

""For me, the most important thing is the relationship with the people of Himachal Pradesh,"" he added.

""But the kind of system prevailing in the government in last one year, how MLAs were overlooked and attempts were made to stifle their voices - this is a result of that,"" he said.

In a shocking political development in the state on Tuesday, the ruling Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi lost the Rajya Sabha election to the BJP's Harsh Mahajan despite the Congress enjoying a comfortable majority in the state assembly.

Both candidates secured 34 votes each in the 68-member state assembly.

Victory tilted towards Mahajan after a draw of lots was held as a tie-breaker.

The victory is even more detrimental in the wake of former BJP Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur's claim that the Sukhu government has been reduced to a minority in the house.

However, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi conceded his defeat and 'thanked' the MLAs who cross-voted leading to the victory of Harsh Mahajan.

""I would also like to thank the nine persons (MLAs) because they have taught me a lot about human nature, its fickleness or its resoluteness. They supped with us. So, I think we are bad judges of human character, they are obviously better judges of human character,"" he said.

Earlier, CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had claimed that opposition leaders were obstructing the work of counting officials, and that ""5-6 Congress MLAs were taken away in a convoy of the CRPF and Haryana Police.

Want to get into some of the hottest sectors in market now? PSU is the name of the game: Ajay Srivastava,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 12:51:00 PM IST","Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate, says “in transmission, defence, big power and oil retailing sectors there is no choice but to get into PSUs. Yes, you have a choice to buy a PSU bank or not to buy a PSU bank, but in these four sectors, you have no choice. We have seen PSUs not performing for two decades or maybe more. After the first leg, people have rarely said it is the new high, but I think it will go higher. PSUs will get more traction certainly in these five sectors including banks.”

What is the market mood because the headline index is moving sideways. It is getting incrementally more difficult to find ideas in the market.
Ajay Srivastava: All markets are difficult. When the market is down, you wonder when you have to invest and when the market is up, you wonder if you are investing on the top. But as I keep saying, if you have a vision of the market, you need to find ways and spots which are trending outside. Go to the laggards. There are lots of sectors which are trending up, which have consolidated and which are going to see the next leg up post election.

So, I do not think one has to be very scared in terms of where the market heights are or that there are so many lakhs of opportunities. The market always gives chances to invest. Market gives you chances to buy into and at the end of the day, if you are not very old, you have no choice but to buy today. Therefore, one should stay clear of mind and say past is past, the future looks good, we need to find a way to invest. How much to invest, when the timing issue is a different matter but to worry about the market is on a high, I do not think you need to be worried about it. Look at the right sectors and you should be fine.

An excellent point with age comes experience and with experience comes precision. I think this is the only game where you get better with age is it not. It is in your favour. The precision is only increasing, is it not?
Ajay Srivastava: I wish so. I wish doctors would find that they get more money as they become older. You would not find a trader in New York who is over 35 years old, by the way. In fact, we have a disadvantage because we know the history of share prices and therefore we get bogged with it. The guy in my office who just walked in this year, joins this year. He does not know what happened 15 years back and therefore he comes with no baggage.

We need to change our approach to market this year onwards. Nimish Chandan explains why
So, to some extent, our experience, grey hair is a disadvantage. The only advantage is having seen so much, done so much. We are not scared of anything. We do not fear the market. We love and embrace the market. That is the only difference perhaps that comes with age, that you tend to know that the market will surprise you, market will over guess you, market is smarter than you and I think once the thought is in your mind, you are much better off investing.

There is a saying on the Street that there are old traders and there are bold traders but there are no old bold traders. But then Buffett made the bulk of the money after 50. So, the best of the returns are backhanded. Indian PSU stocks were never graded as investment grade. They were just point A to point B and then exit kind of plays. Over the years their business models have become more robust and efficiencies are clearly visible in numbers, but valuations did become a question mark because they shot up in a very short span of time. During 2024, if the PSUs correct, would you be comfortable getting back in there for a three- to five-year view?
Ajay Srivastava: Getting back I do not know because we are already invested in it. In some sectors, you have no choice but to go into PSUs like the defence sector. We do not have any big private defence company in this country, at least at this point of time. Some may emerge over time. Bharat Forge may come in or a smaller set up may go, but if you want to buy defence you have no choice but to buy the PSU company.

If you want to buy oil marketing companies which have a huge reach in this country, you have no choice but to buy PSUs. If you look at power stocks at this point of time, the company with the highest power capacity is a PSU stock. If you look at transmission companies, you do not have an option but to buy into a PSU transmission company because there is none which exists in the private sector.

So, the debate whether we can buy or not is not a choice if you want to be in the transmission, defence, big power and oil retailing sectors. In these four sectors, there is no choice. Yes, you have a choice to buy a PSU bank or not to buy a PSU bank, but if you look at these four-five sectors, you have no choice. My guess is that these sectors will have just seen the first run-up after almost two decades. We have seen PSUs not performing for two decades or maybe more. After the first leg, people have kind of rarely said it is the new high, but I think it will go higher.

No red flag in market but expect low teens returns: Siddharth Srivastava
PSUs will get more traction certainly in the five sectors we have spoken about just now because simply there is none which exists and there is no competition and anybody who wants to come into India in these five sectors has to go to the PSUs. So, my guess is that these five-six sectors including say power finance, now that is a unique niche in this country which again with the PSUs, you cannot go anywhere else, PSUs.

You want to ignore the sectors? Sure. You want to be in the sectors, PSU is your game and I think they will give much better returns because for one reason the dividend policies are now specified. So, with the dividend yield, these become very attractive buys and debt is not their concern, they are government guaranteed so they can borrow the best rates, professional management well one can say yes to some extent but OMCs would say it is not professionally managed because the rates are governed by the government at this point of time.

Having said, overall it looks positive and with the new government coming in, there will be more divestments and more accountability, boards will get professionalised. So, it is a good wicket to be in at least in the five sectors.

What are your thoughts when you compare PSU banks with private banks?
Ajay Srivastava: We do not have too many banks in our portfolio, neither in advisory at this point of time for the simple reason that these are behemoths who have lost to the competition. They did not invest enough and once the RBI removed the umbrella of no new licenses and the fintechs came in and NBFCs got a little bit of a leg-up, these banks were found wanting. Leave aside HDFC Bank where the merger was a disaster. So leave that aside, it is a good institution but it will take its own time to come up. But by and large, this is one sector which has lagged behind because when RBI gave them such a comfort of no competition, they never thought of the consumer at the end of the day and that is what fintechs came and did.

The core constituency of the banks was to keep your money cheap and lend at leisure including government securities. So, you kept your fixed deposit at 5-6%, they were putting in government treasury at 7-8%. CASA was next to nothing. I think that model is under threat at this point of time and therefore banks will see a consistent problem because their raw material, the cheap raw material, is now becoming more expensive, just like any manufacturing company. If the raw material goes up your margins tend to shrink because the customer can get his options.

So, the banks are going to have a problem with their basic raw material, cheap deposits whittling down, it cannot disappear, people love to put money in the bank but it will whittle down. Therefore, I would tend to believe that our industrial sectors, our equity linked sectors would be far better choices than banks at this point of time in terms of return on capital.

You may have observed that big money seems to be positioning in some of the very beaten down kinds of NBFCs in the last few weeks. Just yesterday, Florintree along with Brookfield decided to put in a big chunk in Indostar, the CV financier that had bombed out. Last week we saw Rs 4000 crore come in the rights issue of Indiabulls Housing. Would you be keen to look at some of these names or will you be wary of them?
Ajay Srivastava: We have moved into but very large NBFCs. We are not moving to small NBFCs and the reason we moved into large NBFCs is the climate for their ability to raise money directly from the public is very good at this point of time. Therefore, among some of the leading funds, one company raised Rs 5,000-crore NCDs in exactly two days from the market.

For the larger NBFCs who can diversify away from the banks, their funding resources, it is going to be a very good time for the next two to three years because they have a clean market for themselves.

Number two, as the banks start to get out of NBFCs or become a little bit careful, the smaller NBFCs will be in trouble in terms of raising. If you can raise equity, like you mentioned, your NBFC is safe and fine. But if you cannot raise equity, we should see lots of consolidation, lots of stress plays happening in the NBFC space. But the top five NBFCs of this country are very good and one can put money in the NBFCs because these guys are getting better yields. They can give LAP loans, commercial vehicle loans. They can give personal loans and control quite well at this point in time. Banks cannot do that. They are going to rely on industrial loans where the yields are going to be low. So, if you look at 4% yields, you have to be in NBFCs. For banks, gradually, the yield will shrink to 2-2.5% at this point of time and therefore, relatively speaking, large NBFCs would do much better for equity returns.

Get into consumer stocks; 2 stocks to buy as metals in a very sweet spot: Sanjiv Bhasin,"Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 11:39:00 AM IST","Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says “it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. We think the real income is going to be generated now from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where we are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.”

Bhasin also says “metals are in a very sweet spot. Vedanta and JSW are two stocks we are betting on.”

Some of the consumer appliances companies, air-conditioner companies have had a very rough patch in the last few months. Voltas, Blue Star have come back. I would like to just bring to your notice a commentary coming in from one of the leading players last evening, which is Godrej Appliances. Yesterday, they said they are expecting 20% growth in the appliances business, including air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc, going into summer. If Godrej has visibility of 20% in appliances, it will surely rub off on the entire sector. Anything which you like there and what is your take on this commentary?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been stating that this is the time to be in consumer goods, whether white goods, staples, or even discretionary. Discretionary has outperformed as you are aware of two-wheeler and four-wheeler, but staples have hardly performed. So, we have been upbeat on Bata, Patanjali. We also own both Havells and Voltas and we think that the real income which is going to be generated now is from the tier II, tier III, and the smaller rural class, that is where you are seeing unprecedented growth. There are no coolers now.

Everyone has moved on to the AC market. And with the advent of lower inflation, lower rates, I think rural India is going to be the one where money is going to be made. So, it is time to book out of those consensus trades of outperformance on PSUs and so on. You should be in consumption stocks because they are looking very good as far as the earnings go. As a disclosure, both Voltas and Havells are in our portfolio and now you weathered the worst of the winter. If you are looking forward to the next six months, anticipation of that sale starts from now. The Godrej commentary is a very big positive from one of the big players in this industry.

Any thoughts on these two, Indostar and IB Housing?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We put our money in IB Housing at Rs 115, 120 when there was no promoter over there with more than 1% holding. Only institutions owned it and it was available almost for free and pessimism was at its highest as the old owners, Banga and the rest of them, had all exited. That was a time you should have been in this stock because the valuation comfort was at 0.4, 0.3 times price to book. Now, all those have made a comeback because NBFC has actually upped the ante and like you pointed out, the industry average is at 1.5, 1.7.

The risk to reward was very favourable and now there is a transition with a new name and new promoters. We did invest, but we have booked out of that. We are now invested in Indiabulls Real Estate, where Embassy’s takeover and the merger is just on the anvil. NCLT will give it by the middle of March and that could be a game changer.

You can imagine what Rs 6,000 crore market cap means for one of the largest marquee builder of property in both Maharashtra and Delhi and I think that Indiabulls Real Estate can be a big game changer here. It also trades at a market cap closer to Rs 5,000, 6,000 crore against even defaulters like Unitech and Parsvnath which have Rs 4,000-5,000 crore market cap. So, risk-reward is very favourable there. Indiabulls Housing Finance is going to be a game changer because of the new structure and over a period of time, it will deliver very good results. A disclosure, Indiabulls Real Estate is where we are very-very bullish.

What is happening to the overall airport economy? Today as well Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on DreamFolks and they are suggesting a target price which is almost 30% to 35% higher than the current market price. Do you think that the entire aviation, hospitality sector, DreamFolks, GMR Airports, have further room on the upside?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I used to stick my neck out because I travel so much pan-India that at 35, I used to say on TV khade honi ki jagha nahi hai airport pe, kaise GMR 35 rupaiya hai?( There’s no place to stand in the airport and GMR share price is Rs 35?). And lo and behold, look at the unlocking of the value. Aerocity is doing rocking business as far as the hotel business goes. They are selling more Black Label than ever. When luxury turns into necessity, then there is no stopping barrier for the expansion on the upside. Go to any airport, in the Bombay Airport Terminal 2, there is a one hour waiting list just to get through.

So, I think this is there to stay. You have to catch on to the right themes which you want to play. I will also take a word, you were mentioning on Vedanta, yesterday I was there at their presentation. The presentation was superb as far as both the non-ferrous and ferrous side.

People are not aware, but in India the largest nickel producer and the only nickel producer is Vedanta. From BALCO, there is aluminium, there is zinc from Hindustan Zinc. You name the product on the non-ferrous side, it is there. Aside from that, there is thermal power, there is gas, and there is energy. So, sum of the parts, the management has clearly indicated that they are not going to raise anything on the company as far as debt goes, they are only going to reduce that.

This morning, Mr Khara of SBI spoke to our colleagues that capacity utilisation across industries is now hitting the 75% mark or thereabout, that is exactly the level from which on green shoots of actual capex enquiries start coming in. He was very confident of 14% to 15% credit growth. SBI was the last mover in banks but has done pretty well. Would you latch on to SBI or some of the big PSU banks like BOB, Can Bank?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We had all of them, PNB, Can Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, part of it in our portfolio, part we booked. But we are more bullish on the private banks, the comfort of earnings, the comfort of CASA ratio and the credit expansion. The liability franchise is just a matter. So, HDFC, Axis, ICICI are our top holdings now and we continue to do SIPs on those. I will go by Mr Khara's word, but SBI has already made a first mover to 750, whereas HDFC and ICICI, Axis are now rearing to go.

I would say private banks will lead the Bank Nifty and I would be more overweight on the private banks. Also, I wish you well in your journey on the voyage on the ship. As a disclosure, ABSL AMC has been under my coverage on your channel from 350-400. Yesterday, it hit a high of 529. Do not sell it till it hits 750, that is my advice to investors.

"Do not believe there is bubble or trouble in the market: Harish Krishnan, ABSL AMC","Last Updated: Feb 28, 2024, 02:29:00 PM IST","Harish Krishnan, Co-CIO & Head -Equity, ABSL AMC, says in the last three years, from about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore of total profits, today we are close to about Rs 13-14 lakh crore of total profits. If you really look at the journey of what the market caps have tracked, it has been pretty much in line. So, it has not been something very ecstatic to say that there is a significant amount of overvaluation, that is point number one.


There is a general view that the run-up has been extraordinary but it is too good to be true and there is bubble and trouble in the market. Can I say the Birla House view is that there is no bubble, there is no trouble.

Are they a good team? Have they welcomed you well?
Harish Krishnan: Yes, they have, but I am taking this opportunity to thank myself.

Okay. It is a good team, good team. Ten years.
Harish Krishnan: So bubble or trouble, I do not think that we are in either camp that we should be very worried about, nor should we be in the camp that we should be greedy. Now, you can think that it is a hedged view that does not go to either extreme. But let me try and paraphrase, when we are asked, market kya lagta hai (how is the market?) because this is what comes to us whether we attend a wedding or a funeral in the side, a fund manager is always asked that.

Even at birthdays, actually
Harish Krishnan: There are basically three things in the market – earnings, liquidity and sentiment and the interplay of that is pretty much what determines the medium-term structure of markets. Now, if I take the first pillar, that of earnings, in the last three years, we have seen earnings double on the base.

So, just to give you some context of numbers, from about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore of total profits, today we are close to about Rs 13-14 lakh crore of total profits. If you really look at the journey of what the market caps have tracked, it has been pretty much in line. So, it has not been something very ecstatic to say that there is a significant amount of overvaluation, that is point number one.

The second point is that our share of GDP in the world is likely to keep going up. Today, we are at close to about 3.5% to 3.6% of world GDP and we definitely think that we should be punching way above that weight in years to come, maybe close to about 6-7% or maybe even 8% of GDP over the course of the next decade or so. If I look at the market cap of India, as a percentage of the world market cap, again we are close to about 3-3.5%. So, where really is a bubble to say that things have gone totally out of whack.

Yes, what we have today is a sentiment which possibly is at its extreme wherein everyone feels that nothing can go wrong in India. Everything that you think both structurally as well as cyclically is going right for India. When I say structurally, we all know all of those things, demographics, the fact that our digital stack is really firing, the fact that our productivity is improving. But even on a cyclical side, the fact that China is on the back foot in so many levels has also meant that cyclical tailwinds have come to India and which is kind of propped up and therefore the fear. Fund managers are always cynical.

The fear is that having got it too good, there can be some kind of a pullback in sentiment. Now, that is something which is very hard to measure and to evaluate and the only solution is to take a slightly longer-term view rather than getting worried about the next 3-6-12 months something can happen in China or China-Taiwan conflict. Beyond a point, there is nothing we can control about it. It is going to do what it will do. Let us focus on the companies and their execution and the capabilities and the growth profile of India.

The last point is that of liquidity. We are just getting started on liquidity. It might surprise you and while we have grown so stupendously as AUM, it might surprise all of you that even today cash in the hands of people is almost equivalent to 75% of all the household wealth that is in markets, including mutual funds, including direct stocks. It is still 75% and that is earning nothing. Despite demonetisation one, two, etc, whatever you have, that is the amount of money which is still earning nothing and which is there in people's homes under whatever mattresses, etc.

We are just about getting started when we think about the greater contours of each of these three elements. The last thing as to why is that we are positive on, of course the global and the macro is that at the end of the day, the source of growth in the future comes from the activities that companies do today. What is the one activity that they have to do to ensure that their growth profile remains sustained is capex.

Now, over the course of the last decade, capex was in neutral gear at about Rs 6-6.5 lakh crore. I am talking about the listed companies. I told you that profits and cash flows are at Rs 13-14 lakh crores. Capex has now moved to Rs 8 lakh crore. After 10 years of no capex, we have started to see the first signs of capex moving to Rs 8 lakh crore. The Rs 8 lakh crore potentially can become Rs 10-12-14 lakh crore in the cycle and that will sow the seeds for the next growth cycle. As long as we are clear that the corporate balance sheet is in good shape, there is a growth profile, yes, there is some exuberance and sentiment in the near term, we have to be mindful and the only solution is asset allocation to have a longer patience rather than expecting fireworks every six months.

Harish Krishnan: I think we all understand and relate to cricket. Now if you look at test match cricket, which is like, say, a marathon investing and I see a lot of parallels between sport and investment, there are three kinds of batsmen. You have got the opening batsmen, you have got the middle order and then you have got the tail ender. Each have a particular purpose.
